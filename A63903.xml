            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Do humbly Dedicate this diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to your Lordſhip, after ſome ſmall, though very Hearty endeavours, to let your Lordſhip and the World ſee how extreamly ſenſible I am of your goodneſs to me, not only out of a principle of gratitude, but intereſt too, in gratitude I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb facs="tcp:98888:3"/> to bethink my ſelf of a preſent more ſuitable to your Lordſhips de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Character and Greatneſs, than any I have yet had the hardineſs or opportunity to make; and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, I conſidered with my ſelf, that having engaged with ſo potent adverſaries as the memory of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who was the glory of the laſt Age, and the living fame of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon yet in being, it concerned me to look out ſome Patron of the Higheſt Quality and the moſt univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged merit, to give ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to my undertakings, which are intended purely for the diſcovery of truth, and for the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the World.</p>
            <p>I have in this Eſſay given a deadly blow to the Rabbinical Learning, not that I pretend or would be thought to ſuggeſt, as if they were not to be believed in any thing they ſay, for who is ſo guilty of miſtakes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb facs="tcp:98888:3"/> as not to ſpeak truth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times? But if by virtue of a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tradition, they ſhall impoſe any falſity upon us, as I have proved in this Treatiſe, they have done very many, we are not to believe any thing upon account of any ſuch precarious Tradition, without other circumſtances and probabilities to vouch it, as a witneſs of crackt credit and profligate reputation, may yet put new wait in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scale of Truth, if he have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their other circumſtances or more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable teſtimony to concur with him, but upon his own account he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and if any have a mind to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the credit of the Rabbins, it is not to be done by proving that in ſome things they have been in the right, but that they are ſo in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, wherein I have laid falſhood and forgery to their charge.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> were alive, I ſhould not deſpair but he would acknowledg his Error and that of thoſe upon whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:98888:4"/> authority and credit he depended, but of the other I have no other hope, then only that he will not pretend <hi>in ſcriptis</hi> to confute me, though he may poſſibly whiſper in the dark, where I can neither hear nor ſee him, and may have a party in the Coffee-houſe to ſtand by him.</p>
            <p>But not content barely to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed theſe two Learned Gentlemen, I have ſubſtituted poſitive and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Doctrines in the room of thoſe which they would have obtruded upon us, I have, I hope, held out a Key to the Learned World, by which the moſt difficult paſſages in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> may be explained, and have beſides given ſo fair an entrance into the Antiquities of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhown ſo plainly their dependance upon thoſe of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> from whence they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably derived, that it is clearly a new ſort of Learning ſcarce ever yet ſo much as pointed at by any, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of very great and very uſefull
<pb facs="tcp:98888:4"/> improvements, all which I do humbly ſubmit to your Lordſhips known Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and unbyaſt Judgment, and with my moſt earneſt Prayers to Almighty God for the continuance of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips health and ſafety, in which that of the publick hath ſo great a ſhare, I am, may it pleaſe your Lordſhip,</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here Preſent you with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the greateſt part of which was long ſince Written, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by which the ſurviving younger Brother was obliged to propagate the name and memory of his Elder Brother in his ſtead, in which I will be bold to ſay, I have diſcovered more of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Antiquity, then all the <hi>Rabbins</hi> put together have with the ſame certainty and convincingneſs done, for moſt of what they tell us amounts to no more then <hi>hear ſay,</hi> depends upon very uncertain and queſtionable Traditions, and is
<pb facs="tcp:98888:6"/> Jumbled together with ſuch an <hi>og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> of monſtrous and impertinent Winter-tales, that it is very difficult, where there is any Truth, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Truth and Falſhood from each other, and beſides this, I have occaſionally ſo far inquired into the moſt remote Antiquities of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to ſhow they were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly of <hi>Eaſtern</hi> growth, and the comparing of the Cuſtoms and Language of the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which I take it for granted is a ſubject, which neither one Man nor one Age can exhauſt, is that, that will give great light and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to both, and may with much more reaſon be depended upon in our inquiries into Truths of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then any of thoſe pompous Tales the <hi>Rabbins</hi> tell us, though dreſt up in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and coming into the World in the ſhape and appearance of profound Learning.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:6"/>
            <p>You will find by ſeveral paſſages, up and down in this Treatiſe, that what I have now written, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as preparatory and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory to another, which it is now a long time, that I have promiſed or threatned, or what you pleaſe to call it, concerning the <hi>Marriage of Coſin Germans,</hi> if you ask in what ſenſe, this may be thought prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to that, though it may ſeem an hard Queſtion, yet I will make it eaſie, by giving it a plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and indeed the Anſwer is two fold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This was a Matrimonial Caſe as well as the other, which though it be now perfectly Antiquated and out of date, not only amongſt us, but even the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, yet I had a mind to ſhew by an Eſſay upon this ſubject, that I was not altogether a ſtranger to ſubjects of this nature, that upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of this performance, I might
<pb facs="tcp:98888:7"/> remove the prejudices that lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and might be thought poſſibly to underſtand what I ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better then thoſe that cenſure me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I affirmed the Marriage of <hi>Coſin Germans</hi> to be in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Politics and in all <hi>ordinary</hi> Caſes <hi>ex antecedenti</hi> prohibited and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, it is to be conſidered, That the Brothers Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Brothers Wife under the Law, was by virtue of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſpenſation in a particular Caſe, though otherwiſe the ſame Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were puniſhable with death, and the Caſe is the ſame in any diſpenſation, it imports an Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs <hi>in non exceptis,</hi> otherwiſe, if the thing diſpenſed with, were generally Lawful, nothing could be more frivolous or more abſurd, then a particular diſpenſation in the Caſe propoſed, let it be what it will; wherefore by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:98888:7"/> that the <hi>Leviratical</hi> or <hi>Anchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtutical</hi> ſanction of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, being a particular diſpenſation in a particular Caſe, did imply a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, where that Caſe was not concerned, by the very ſame reaſon does the Marriage of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi> in the 36 of <hi>Numbers,</hi> imply a prohibition in all other Caſes, where the ſame circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could not lay claim to any ſuch particular and extraordinary diſpenſation, which having only a regard to the <hi>partition of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> is now finally deſtroyed, ſuch Marriages are now Unlawful to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, and much more certainly to all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom the natural reaſons upon which the Matrimonial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions depended are the ſame, that they were to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the obligation to all the inſtances of charity, friendſhip and good will,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:8"/> and all the means conducing to it, is greater and more binding then it was upon them, for the ſake of our <hi>common Saviour</hi> who loved us ſo much, and who made this the Mark and Character of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by which they might always be diſcerned from the reſt of the World, <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples if ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But however this Chriſtian Charity as great and as univerſal, as it is or ought to be, yet it does not forbid us in Caſes of neceſſity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our Perſons or Poſſeſſions, or to aſſert or vindicate our good Names againſt ſuch as make it their buſineſs to injure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame us, therefore you are not to expect, that I ſhould upon this Text, ſtand up and Preach a Recantation Sermon for the late ſeverities upon Dr. <hi>C.</hi> which I am ſo far from, that in this very Diſcourſe I have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my blow and have reſolved of
<pb facs="tcp:98888:8"/> a long time, neither to give him any Quarter nor take any from him, and yet now I think of it, I have given it notwithſtanding, for there are faults in the <hi>Syſtem,</hi> which I have not expoſed, and there are faults in the <hi>Syſtemer,</hi> which are not in the <hi>Syſtem,</hi> but if any elſe have a mind to try their parts upon the ſame Arguments, I have engaged him upon, without making the Controverſie perſonal between us, I ſhall not be behind hand in Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with them, only there are two things in this following Diſcourſe, for one of which I muſt Apologize, and the other I find my ſelf obliged to Recant that which needs an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology is this <hi>p. 205, &amp;c.</hi> where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the fact of <hi>Zimri,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, 1 Kings 16. that <hi>he went into the Palace of the Kings Houſe and burnt the Kings Houſe over him with fire, and dyed.</hi> I may be thought upon this occaſion to have ſpoken
<pb facs="tcp:98888:9"/> too favourably concerning ſelf ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide in ſome Caſes, wherefore ſince I have dipt into this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie which is very nice, that I may ſet all things right, and offer my moſt mature ſentiments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I deſire it may be conſidered, Firſt, That I have not in the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed any who out of fanciful Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or a vincible Melancholy not yet improved into a ſtate of frenzy, have been the Authors of untimely death to themſelves, becauſe all theſe Caſes are manifeſtly ſuppoſed to be ſo many inſtances of unreaſonable Actions, and therefore can by no means juſtifie themſelves. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There are ſome inſtances to be met with in the World, of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that are unqueſtionably real, exquiſitely painful, and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, or ſuch as at preſent ſeem ſo, without any hopes of remedy, not only in the opinion of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affected, but alſo of the wiſeſt,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:9"/> moſt experienced, and moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Phyſitians themſelves, and this was <hi>Seneca's</hi> Caſe by reaſon of a Chronical <hi>ſuſpirium,</hi> or <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of breath</hi> which he complains of in ſeveral of his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and in one of them he ſays, that if it had not been in conſideration of his Aged Father, and out of tenderneſs to his Relations, who might have taken his death immoderately to heart, he would have made away with himſelf, and I am far from diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging any ſuch conſiderations as theſe, to perſuade a Man even in the worſt circumſtances, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to endure them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and ſteady reſolution, and to expect with patience the call of nature, rather then to get rid of them by any act of violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As in the Caſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pain, ſo alſo in that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream and irretrievable ignominy
<pb facs="tcp:98888:10"/> and diſgrace, which is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and inſupportable torment of a reaſonable or a gallant mind, if I have ſpoken any thing favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly concerning the practice of ſelf-homicide likewiſe in this Caſe; I did it only out of a charitable Principle to thoſe gallant and good Men, whoſe Virtue and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in all other reſpects were ſcarce ever called into queſtion by their <hi>greateſt</hi> Enemies themſelves; and ſuch an inſtance as this would <hi>Seneca</hi> have been, if he had done what he deſigned in the former Caſe of pain, and ſuch <hi>Cato</hi> was in the latter of diſgrace, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, and that he might not fall into the hands of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate and mortal enemies, he thought it his wiſeſt courſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and anticipate their contempt of his perſon, and all the barbarous outrages of a victorious Army, by a generous contempt of that ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:98888:10"/> remainder of life, which either his nature or his fate had left him, and yet this is that <hi>Cato</hi> of whom <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> gives ſo lofty and ſo excellent a character, that no mortal Man can ever deſerve a greater, and one particular ingredient of it, is, that nature and reaſon were in all his actions his perpetual guides. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>—Hi mores, haec duri immota Catonis</l>
                  <l>Secta fuit, ſervare modum, finem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tenere,</l>
                  <l>Naturamque ſequi, patriaeque im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendere vitam,</l>
                  <l>Nec ſibi, ſed toti genitum ſe credere mundo.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Fourthly, It ſeems ſomething hard and unequal to condemn that as unnatural, and in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatſoever prohibited and unlawful to a wiſe Man, which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> a wiſe ſect, and the greateſt Maſters of their paſſions of any other, did univerſally allow,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:11"/> when ever life became burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or uneaſie to its owners, and which notwithſtanding that there are many inſtances of it to be found in Scripture, yet it is no where, that I know of, mentioned with any reprehenſion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I ſay, that Life being the moſt precious and valuable gift that nature can beſtow, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the greateſt Ornament and Supporter of it, as well in ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as in a ſociety or body of Men, there being but few Men whoſe circumſtances would not be uneaſie, and no ſociety that could ſubſiſt without it; it becomes a wiſe Man, and it is his duty upon natural reaſons for the good of the World, for the promoting of which <hi>pro virili parte</hi> he is ſent into it, to be ſo far from giving way to fancy or to melancholy, or from ſinking into diſpair under ſmall and tolerbale miſchiefs,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:11"/> that even in the worſt of ills that can befall him, he ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour his utmoſt, and to muſter up all the ſtrength of his body and mind, to give a remarkable example of that virtue, which is ſo becoming and lovely in it ſelf, and of ſuch uſe and ſervice to mankind.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In Caſes of pain or of diſgrace, if they are the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an ill ſpent life, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the moſt part they are, if they are owing to intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or other crimes, a Man in this caſe owes an example to the World, and as the beſt amends he can make for the guilt he hath contracted, he ought to endure patiently whatſoever befalls him, for the publick good, that ſo his ſufferings may be the greater warning to others, not to tread in his ſteps, or imitate his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore in this reſpect I confeſs, that <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98888:12"/> whom I may ſeem to have juſtified for their laſt Act, which was an Act of violence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, were guilty of as great and real a ſin, as any they committed in the whole courſe of their lives, becauſe they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have ſuffered the utmoſt indignities, and the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite torments in the view of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and from the hands of their Enemies, that ſo the memory of their wickedneſs, and the dread of doing like them, might take the deeper root in the minds of ſuch as beheld it, but all that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in their behalf was only this, that it was an Argument of ſome gallantry, and greatneſs of ſpirit to do as they did, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to which they were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; however, whan all things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re impartially conſider'd, it may and it does appear to be a breach of Duty.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:12"/>
            <p>Beſides, that upon ſuppoſition of a future life, of which not only revelation, but nature doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aſſure us, wherein it ſhall be better or worſe with us for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, according to our behaviour or deportment here, it is fooliſh and unreaſonable for Men in ſuch circumſtances, that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void leſs painful, and leſs durable miſchiefs, to leap into thoſe by an untimely Fate, which are at once more miſerable and morel aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to eſcape without repentance; and he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to repent him of his paſt crimes, who takes his leave of the World, by an action including an offence againſt it, as I have ſhewn all ſelf-homicide in this Caſe to do, but bating theſe reaſons, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering only what there is elſe to be conſidered, I cannot underſtand the courage of encountring to no
<pb facs="tcp:98888:13"/> purpoſe, with hopeleſs, helpleſs, endleſs, and inſupportable calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and it ſeems a kind of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that it ſhould be thought a ſign of magnanimity for a man to continue any longer upon the ſtage of Life, when at the ſame time, he either is or ought to be aſhamed, and afraid to ſee the light any longer.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, I am, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing I have ſaid, and have always been a profeſt admirer of of the Wiſdom of our Laws, which have loaded the Authors of untimely death to themſelves, with marks of the higheſt ignominy and diſgrace, and beſides have puniſht them ſeverely in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, though they are paſt the ſenſe of any human puniſhment, in their own perſons, the reaſon is, becauſe whatever may be ſaid in ſome Caſes, for private and ſingle perſons conſidered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:13"/> yet it is the undoubted wiſdom of a ſociety or body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, to take the moſt effectual care for its own preſervation, and not to ſuffer any member to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it ſelf, from that Service and Duty which it owes to it, without any brand of puniſhment or token of diſgrace; beſides, that ſince every Man is the beſt judge of what he feels, and perceives within himſelf, that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable or inſufferable to him, which is not ſo to another, and therefore, if it be not Lawful for every Man to quit his ſtation, and ſhut up the ſcene of Life, as often as guilt, or melancholy, or fancy ſhall make life troubleſome and uneaſie to him, it muſt, and can only be reſtrained by an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and general prohibition, whoſe ſanction ſhall be impartial and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in all Caſes, and it muſt be acknowledged to have been a very
<pb facs="tcp:98888:14"/> great defect in all thoſe ancient Laws, before Chriſtianity took place in the World, which do not ſeem to have made that proviſion againſt ſo bad a practice, and ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the welfare of ſociety, which ours are known to have done.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Where the Laws of any Country or Society, do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and puniſh ſuch violencies as theſe, committed by Men wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon themſelves, there it is for that very reaſon abſolutely Unlawful, becauſe this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Society, that every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, whatever natural liberty he had before, he hath only ſo much freedom left him after his entring into, and ingaging in it, as the Laws of that Society have not reſtrained, and with as much reaſon as one Lawful Command of our Superiours, or our Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may be violated and broken,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:14"/> all may, and ſo the Society is actually diſſolved, which is fenced in by Laws and cannot otherwiſe be preſerved, then by a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious and dutiful obſervation of them.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, If againſt this it be objected, that he who is the cauſe of untimely death to himſelf, is not bound before hand, when he deliberates concerning it, to have any regard to the Laws of that Society, which by this fact he is about to leave, and conſequently expects no further favour or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from it, and after the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his intended deſign, is out of capacity of receiving any, which is the true reaſon why eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man becomes or continues to be a member of community, that the Laws of that community un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he liſts himſelf may guard and defend him againſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
<pb facs="tcp:98888:15"/> and wrong, and protect him in the purſuit of all his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable projects and deſigns; To this there are three things to be Anſwered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When a Man enters and ingages himſelf in a Society, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he looſes all that liberty of action, which the Laws have thought it neceſſary to reſtrain, or he does not, if the former, then the prohibition of ſelf-homicide, as being <hi>ex hypotheſi</hi> a branch of the ſaid Laws, is as much and as firmly obligatory and binding, as any other reſtraint or prohibition whatſoever; if the latter, then the obligation to all Laws, and the Authority by which they are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, being equal and the ſame, it is manifeſt we may diſpence with our ſelves in any other inſtance, as well as in this, and ſo the whole Fabrick of Govenment falls to the ground.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:15"/>
            <p>But Secondly, We are not only tyed to the obſervation of all the Lawful commands of our Prince or Country, by the Authority of men, but by <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> by which all the Laws of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are tyed upon us, and nothing certainly can be of more fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to a man in the other World, then, that the laſt action of his life, ſhould be a <hi>willful</hi> breach of that <hi>Oath,</hi> which includes a defiance of the Divine Power and Juſtice, in this, and ſuch a defiance as frequently gives no time at all, but very rarely affords in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate anguiſh, and perplext hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a wounded mind and body, ſufficient means, opportunity and time for an hearty and a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the ſame reaſon that a man ſhall pretend it Lawful to rid himſelf of an uneaſie World, notwithſtanding the Laws of his
<pb facs="tcp:98888:16"/> Country forbid any ſuch practice, under pretence that the reaſon why he entred into Society, was only to receive a ſafe guard and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from it, and that now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all benefit from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, he is under no obligation to its Laws, by the very ſame reaſon an Highway-man, or a Midnight, houſe-breaker, may excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for he alſo by affronting and violating the Laws, does diſclaim all benefit and protection from them, yet he is never the leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for all this, for he does ſtill break and violate <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> and diſturb the peace and welfare of mankind, one of which the Laws of nature, and the neceſſities of humane life, do forbid him to do, and the other is a breach of a no leſs ſacred, though a ſuperinduced and poſitive obligation, and this brings me to a Tenth thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:16"/>
            <p>For in the Tenth place, Though the Laws of a Society ſhould not peradventure forbid the practice of ſelf-homicide, yet it is ſufficient that the nature of a Society does, as if the Laws ſhould not forbid Adultery or Theft, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they would be never the leſs unlawful, becauſe they tend to contention and ſtrife, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the publick peace, and to the diſſolution of Society, the end of which is mutual happyneſs, and mutual preſervation, and ſo in this caſe alſo, of ſelf-homicide in any inſtance, though it might perhaps be juſtifiable, or at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable as a ſingle inſtance conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it ſelf, and without relation to any civil Society; of which he that committed it, was formerly a member, yet ſtanding in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, let the circumſtances of his action be never ſo favourable, and propitious to themſelves, yet it is
<pb facs="tcp:98888:17"/> enough that the action it ſelf, with whatever circumſtances it may happen to be clothed, yet it is of pernicious conſequence to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that it would certainly produce very bad effects, if it ſhould be drawn into preſident or example, as if, we ſhould ſuppoſe a man otherwiſe of an exact, or at leaſt an unuſual and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary virtue, labouring under ſome hereditary diſtemper, of Gout or Stone, or Conſumption, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a long time under the one, and afflicted with frequent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent returns of the other, againſt whom the above mentioned Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument does not lie, that he owes an example of puniſhment to the World, to which he is ſenſible he can be no longer uſeful, but is and is like to be, without any hopes of remedy, a perpetual plague and torment to himſelf, I ſhould not much doubt the Lawfulneſs
<pb facs="tcp:98888:17"/> of this Mans action, conſidered as a ſingle perſon, and without regard to Society, (if ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition can or ought to be made) though he ſhould make uſe of ſome violence upon himſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then conflict any longer with exquiſite Torments and incurable Evils, to little or no purpoſe; but if we conſider this Man as a member of Community, then whatever may be pleaded in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of his fact conſidered by it ſelf, though it may appear never ſo reaſonable, ſo neceſſary, or ſo juſt, if you reſpect no body but him, yet in its conſequence it will Patronize Fancy, and Melancholy, and Womaniſh fears or frantick deſpair, or any thing elſe that ſhall be the occaſion of the ſame violence, acted upon themſelves, in others. For this is certain, that incurable Fancies are as real things to thoſe that are actuated and
<pb facs="tcp:98888:18"/> poſſeſt by them, and every whit as painful and tormenting, as the moſt uneaſie realities that the World affords, or the utmoſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of misfortune can aſpire to, and every man being the beſt judge of what he endures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for <hi>none knoweth the thoughts of a Man, but the ſpirit of a Man which is in him;</hi> from hence it will unavoidably come to paſs, that that action which in another might have appeared reaſonable, or excuſable at leaſt, will be drawn in its conſequence to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize all the Tragedies, which either Melancholy or guilt ſhall act, and upon the ſame principle, upon which ſome have killed themſelves, to get rid of their own fears and Fancies, by which they were inceſſantly purſued, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a fit of Melancholy have been known to make away their Wives and Children, to take them
<pb facs="tcp:98888:18"/> away from the evil to come, or to prevent that Scene of miſchiefs, which Fancy had painted as hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their heads, and ready to fall down in ſhowers of miſery, and misfortune upon them: now this is enough to make any action Unlawful, though by it ſelf it might poſſibly do no hurt, if Imitated by others upon the ſame or like pretences, it ſhall appear to be pernicious to the publick, as I have elſewhere argued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Marriage of <hi>Coſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> we are to conſider what the conſequence would be, if it were frequently practiſed, not what it is where the inſtances are ſo few, for there is no doubt but publick and private good, are the meaſure of good and evil in theſe caſes, and whatever that action is, which growing faſhionable, and being generally practiſed, would redound to the prejudice of the
<pb facs="tcp:98888:19"/> publick, that action even in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance is Unlawful, becauſe every pattern hath a tendency to imitation, and that imitation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated wide, would be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to the publick. So that I muſt here inculcate once more, that if I have any where ſpoken favourably of the practice of ſelf-homicide, it was only in theſe reſpects, that in ſome Caſes it may appear to be an Argument of gallantry and courage, and that I am very willing to entertain ſome Charity for thoſe great Men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who have been guilty of it, and who are ſo far from being blamed for what they did, in the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they were in, that they are mentioned for it, with Honour and Commendation by the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors; not to add that they ſeem to have received this, as well as other of their Cuſtoms from the
<pb facs="tcp:98888:19"/> 
               <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where it ſeems to have been a very common practice, we have ſeveral inſtances of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>Armour-bearer,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> all of whom, whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſonal faults they might be guilty of, as ſome of them were guilty of the greateſt that can be committed, yet they are no where blamed for this laſt act of their lives, and perhaps upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that there was no life after this, which moſt if not all of them ſeem to have believed, and a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery it was with which <hi>Rome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> was utterly unacquainted; it might appear more reaſonable then it can do now, after <hi>life and immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eleventhly, What hath been ſaid above of wicked Men, that they owe an example of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſgrace to the World,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:20"/> and therefore that others may take the more effectuall warning by them, they are to endure with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the worſt that can happen, which is the beſt amends they can make for the miſchiefs, or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of their life paſt, and which added to an hearty and ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, may perhaps be available with God in their behalves to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act no further puniſhment in the life to come; The ſame is true likewiſe of thoſe that ſuffer for a good and righteous Cauſe, that they are not to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from any torment, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by an untimely death, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed and brought upon themſelves, but are rather under a great and ſacred obligation, if they cannot avoid it by flight or by concealment in a dangerous time, to ſtand the brunt of their adverſaries, and expect the worſt that can befal them, though for
<pb facs="tcp:98888:20"/> another reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That they may bear the more effectual Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and do the more ſignal and remarkable ſervice to the Cauſe and Principles for which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, it being natural for great and publick ſufferings to create a pity for the worſt of Men; but for ſuch as die, or are expoſed to poverty, contempt or torments for the ſake of goodneſs, or becauſe they will not ſtart from their Principles, or flinch from their Religion, but are reſolved to bear a conſtant and unſhaken Teſtimony to it, this hath a ſtrange power of Rhetorick and perſuaſion, and is naturally apt to inſpire, and actuate the minds of Men with pity, love, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the perſons of the ſufferers, and for the Cauſe for which they ſuffer, according to that known ſaying, <hi>Sanguis martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:21"/>
            <p>Twelfthly, If a Man perceive himſelf to labour under any ſuch fearful apprehenſion, and dejected proſpect of the ſufferings he is to undergo, that he is in danger ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to renounce the truth, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his quiet and deliverance, from thoſe evils that hang over his head, and fill his mind with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and dreadful apprehenſion; or otherwiſe that he is not like to ſupport himſelf under his calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo as not to do diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Cauſe for which he ſuffers, inſtead of giving reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or advantage to it, yet even in this caſe he is not by any means to caſt away himſelf, but to call to his aid the conſideration of his Innocence, the pleaſant and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflections upon his virtue, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the hopes of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous recompence in the World to come, which will have a natural tendency to create a contempt in
<pb facs="tcp:98888:21"/> him, of the malice of his enemies, and of the utmoſt cruelty of the moſt ingenious tormentors; and he ought beſides to fly to God for the aſſiſtance of his Grace, and to believe ſtedfaſtly that he will not fail to afford it in the Critical time, (whatever dejection of Spirit he may labour under at preſent) which whoever ſhall diſtruſt, being placed in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as theſe, that do ſo naturally require the aſſiſtance of Divine grace, and ſo powerfully draw down its influence upon themſelves, he is guilty of a crime that deſerves a worſe puniſhment, than any his perſecutors can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon him.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, Notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <hi>Moſaic Decalogue</hi> in that precept of it, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill,</hi> or <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98888:22"/> did not forbid ſelf-homicide, or ſelf-Murther, for it is manifeſt by our <hi>Saviours</hi> partition, that all of thoſe precepts concerned only God and our Neighbour, God as the object of Religious worſhip, and our Neighbour as the object of Civil converſation, where he tells us, that <hi>on theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets; Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is plainly ſo, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this, that there are crimes whoſe guilt was Capital by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which yet are no where forbidden by the Decalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, or Ten Commandments, I will inſtance in the habitual Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, which was one of the crimes laid to the charge of the Rebellious Son in the Law, who after admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition continuing unreclaimable,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:22"/> was to be brought forth, and ſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Congregation, and yet this ſin is no where forbidden in any of theſe Commandments, the reaſon is, becauſe it was only a perſonal crime, and did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any ſin againſt God, in that ſenſe in which the Decalogue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, which is concerned only in the prohibition of Idolatry, and Perjury, which includes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the Divine Exiſtence, or which is worſe, a manifeſt defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and contempt of it; and in ſeparating the Sabbath from the reſt of the week, and devoting it to his peculiar, and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Worſhip and Service, nor any breach of Duty towards our Neighbour, any otherwiſe then by the bad example, which for the moſt part, is ſo far from being intended, that it is not ſo much as thought of by the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and which it is always in his
<pb facs="tcp:98888:23"/> Neighbours power either to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or let alone as he pleaſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that there is no violence committed either upon his perſon, or any of thoſe rights, priviledges, or poſſeſſions which are external to him.</p>
            <p>So alſo when the Law forbad <hi>Sodomy,</hi> or the uſe of Carnality contrary to nature, and when it forbad inceſtuous Conjunctions, or Marriages within ſuch certain degrees, how ſevere ſoever the Sanction of theſe prohibitions is, in thoſe places of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> where they are found, yet the Decalogue does not at all concern it ſelf about them, the reaſon is, becauſe though in this caſe there be a mutual offence, committed between both of the contracting parties, in one of theſe inſtances, and between the <hi>Pathicus</hi> and the <hi>Cinaedus</hi> in the other, yet it was not an offence violently
<pb facs="tcp:98888:23"/> committed by one of the parties upon the other, for then it could not be mutual in them both, but it was by mutual, reciprocal and interchangeable conſent; whereas the Decalogue was only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe injuries, which were done violently and without his conſent to our Neighbour, as will appear ſufficiently, by reflecting upon all the inſtances of prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in the ſecond Table; ſo that in this caſe, ſo far as theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments had any thing to do, the maxim was as true then as it is now, <hi>volenti non ſit injuria,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was the injury, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, perſonal, ſince they were both conſenting, but only an injury of example, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Publick, by ſetting a Copy to it, which it was againſt its intereſt to tranſcribe, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate by imitation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:24"/>
            <p>Neither is it ſufficient in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſay, that when our Saviour enjoyns us to <hi>love our Neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> that therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may not do to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we may not do to our ſelves, &amp; conſequently that ſelf-homicide is by this general precept interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it is Unlawful to kill another man, for though I grant it to be Unlawful upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations above mentioned, and in general, whatſoever is againſt the intereſt of humane Society, or the good of Common life, that is certainly Unlawful to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man; yet in this general rule there is nothing more underſtood, then in that other of our bleſſed Lord, which is equivalent to it, whereby we are enjoyned in all caſes that can happen, as a certain rule of life and action, <hi>to do by others, as we would that others in the ſame circumſtances ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:98888:24"/> have done by our ſelves;</hi> but yet this hinders not, but that there are ſeveral things which I may do by my ſelf, which yet it would be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unjuſt, unreaſonable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for me to do by any other Man; as I may give away of mine own as I pleaſe my ſelf, according to that of our Saviour, Matth. 20. 15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> but yet if I ſhould do the ſame, by the <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum</hi> of another committed to my truſt and charge, this would be the higheſt violation of the Laws of Friendſhip, Juſtice and Society, that can be imagined, and ſo alſo in this caſe, let ſelf-homicide be Lawful or Unlawful in it ſelf, and upon other conſiderations, yet there is no queſtion, but a Man may diſpoſe of his own perſon, farther then he hath any natural right to do of another Mans, and that the one is by no means the meaſure of the other.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:25"/>
            <p>To conclude this Thirteenth particular, as it does not appear that ſelf-homicide, was any where forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but on the contrary there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances of it, mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſeverity of reflection upon them, ſo that it ſeems to have been not unfrequently practiſed in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and from thence the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did probably derive, that piece of gallanty, as they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; ſo it ſeems in a manner ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impracticable, that it ſhould have been prohibited by the <hi>Moſaic</hi> diſpenſation, for every Law muſt have a Sanction to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, and to him that fears not death, what Sanction can there be? unleſs it be the conſideration of his Family or Poſterity, which might ſuffer by the Alienation or Forfeiture of his Eſtate, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us which would have been one means to deſtroy the
<pb facs="tcp:98888:25"/> the partition of Inheritances, which it was one great care of the Law religiouſly to preſerve, as may be ſeen in ſeveral paſſages of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſeems to have been utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and <hi>oeconomy of things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what hath been ſaid, I believe it to be the Duty of every Man to run upon certain death, rather then break his truſt or violate a Lawful promiſe, which was the caſe of <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Story, becauſe truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs are the great and firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of Society, the greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and friends to humane Life, and therefore ought not to be violated in any caſe whatſoever, the example being of ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence to the peace and welfare of Mankind.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:26"/>
            <p>Fifteenthly, If a Man by his death may free his Country or the World from any preſent Calamity or epidemical Evil, which is ſaid to have been the caſe of <hi>Curtius</hi> in a violent Plague, or may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and reſcue it out of the jaws of an impending danger, as the <hi>Decii</hi> are ſaid to have done, by devoting themſelves as Sacrifices for the ſafety of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army and State, in both of theſe caſes if there be a rational ground of hope, that my death or yours may be available to the publick good, and may be more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial then our lives could have proved, we are bound by all the ſtricteſt obligations, that either nature or religion can impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to deliver our ſelves up as victims to the publick, whoſe ſafety is more precious in the ſight of God, and more to be priſed and valued in the eſteem
<pb facs="tcp:98888:26"/> of all good Men, then that of any ſingle perſon can be.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, Notwithſtanding that there are ſeveral inſtances of ſelf-homicide in Scripture, and none of them mentioned with any thing of diſallowance, yet there are, as I have ſhewn, reaſons in nature that do make it in all caſes unlawful to a Man conſidered as a member of Society, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſaid in behalf of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons conſidered out of that ſtate, if ſuch a ſuppoſition can or ought to be made, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be pleaded as to the Gallantry or Courage of the Action, in Men that have not conſidered and deliberated the whole caſe with that nicety that I have done, and this is fully repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> where when his Wife in the extremity of his misfortune, gave him this advice, <hi>curſe God and die,</hi> that is,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:27"/> make away with your ſelf, as others in ſuch circumſtances are wont to do, all the anſwer he gives is, <hi>thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh Women ſpeaketh,</hi> that is, that though it were a received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it was Lawful in ſuch caſes, for a Man to diſpatch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the way, and an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice to do it, yet it was an opinion and practice founded upon raſhneſs and want of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and that whoever laid all things impartially together, would patiently endure the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of God, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were intended for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins, or an exerciſe of our patience, or an inſtance of his Soveraignty and Dominion over us, it ought in all theſe caſes to be ſubmitted to, and therefore he uſed all the motives and Arguments he could think of with himſelf, to bring his mind
<pb facs="tcp:98888:27"/> to an abſolute reſignation, <hi>ſhall we receive good,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at the hands of God, and ſhall we not receive evil,</hi> and though he wiſht to die, and longed for nothing more then to be rid of Life and Calamity toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>O that I might have my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and that God would grant me the thing that I long for, even that it would pleaſe God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me, that he would let looſe his hand and cut me off,</hi> yet would he not execute the ſentence of death upon himſelf, and by his example, which was no queſtion inſpired; as well as his writings, he hath taught us what a wiſe Man ought to do in ſuch unfortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as his were.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, If ſelf-homicide be, as it hath been ſhewn in moſt, if not all the inſtances that can be ſuppoſed, be ſo extreemly ſinful, unreaſonable and unlawful, then all kinds of intemperance and exceſs
<pb facs="tcp:98888:28"/> are ſo too, eſpecially where they grow Cuſtomary and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in us, becauſe theſe are ſo many willful tendencies to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and they are ſo much the more inexcuſable, becauſe they are uſually more deliberate, then moſt of the inſtances of ſelf-homicide are and are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when we have or might have had a free uſe and exerciſe of our reaſon.</p>
            <p>Eighteenthly, If ſelf-homicide be ſo Unlawful as it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, how much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and guilty muſt it needs be to imbrue our Hands in the Blood of our Neighbour, whoſe perſon is certainly leſs at our diſpoſal then our own, and with whom, unleſs it be in our own juſt and neceſſary defence, we have nothing more to do, then only to help and aſſiſt him what we can.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98888:28"/>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this buſineſs with ſaying, what I am ſure is true, that no affection of Novelty or love of Paradox drew me into a diſcourſe of this Subject in the following Treatiſe, but that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly light upon it, before I was aware, and that I ſhould be very ſorry, if any thing that I have ſaid upon that occaſion ſhould give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any wiſe or good Man, though, I hope, in this review of that whole matter, which I have endeavoured carefully to conſider, I have made ſome amends for what is amiſs in the body of the Book, if any man ſhall happen to be diſpleaſed at it.</p>
            <p>The other thing which I have in my mind, and which I find my ſelf obliged to Recant, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Year of <hi>Numa,</hi> which I was very confident I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but I have made a new diſcovery ſince that, and that is,
<pb facs="tcp:98888:29"/> that I know nothing of it, and I conceive at this diſtance of time, it is impoſſible to be explained; however upon the whole matter, I hope you will not repent the peruſal of this Book, nor I that I have written it.</p>

            <p>I will inſtance in the <hi>Egyptians</hi> abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from Swines Fleſh and from Fiſh, which tho it be aſcribed by <hi>Porphyry</hi> and out of him by other Learned men, to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſons, for the avoiding of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy the common diſeaſe of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, yet it might be upon ſuch <hi>Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſons</hi> likewiſe, as were, if I am not miſtaken, the ground of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. And which I have in other Papers more largely inſiſted upon. And tho it be not in other Inſtances ſo eaſy to prove that the ſame prohibitions did obtain among the neighbour Nations, yet there are two things to be conſidered which will make it very probable that they did.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98888:34"/>
            <p>Firſt. That the diſtinction of beaſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to clean and unclean is manifeſtly of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Antiquity than the Floud, as is evident by this, that according to this diſtinction they were admitted into the Ark either by two's or Sevens and being ſpoken of there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any particular directions to <hi>Noah,</hi> by which he ſhould know the clean and unclean from one another. It ſeems plain that he and his contemporaries were acquainted with this diſtinction and the bounds of it before, and very probable that it had been conſtantly obſerved from the Creation until then, there being no reaſon why it ſhould not, nor any time imaginable wherein it can be affirmed that it did not obtain.</p>
            <p>You will ſay perhaps that before the Flood, the Fleſh of animals was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be eaten, which is true, and that the nature of this cleanneſs or uncleanneſs in animals conſiſted in this, that the one were prohibited, the other allowed in food; which is true likewiſe, but it is not the whole truth, for they were allowed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited reſpectively in Sacrifice as well as food, therefore, ſince men did ſacrifice Animals before the Floud, tho they did not feed upon them, it is clear that this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might well enough obtain before that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98888:34"/> time, which brings me to the Second thing; by which will it appear highly reaſonable to believe that the very diſtinction of clean and unclean Beaſts and Birds, and in the ſame inſtances, was obſerved before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Law, as well as after, and by other Nations as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi> And that is,</p>
            <p>That you no where meet with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as the common practice of a Nation, at leaſt for any ſo ancient, I dare boldly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you, that any of thoſe either Birds or Beaſts mention'd in the unclean Catalogue have been offered up for Sacrifice, neither do we or any Nation that I know of, uſe any, or but very few, of them to this day in our food. The ſame may be ſaid of Fiſhes, of which thoſe that want Fins and Scales, are even amongſt us accounted the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as they are certainly the moſt unwholſome kind, and for the Sacrifice of Fiſh, it will be as hard to meet with it, unleſs it be here and there a particular, and perhaps a fabulous inſtance in profane Authors, as in the writings of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the prohibitions, ſo alſo the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for Food and Sacrifices, are and have always been in almoſt all Nations and all times the ſame with thoſe of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98888:35"/> Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, as is evident in part from the Sacrifices of <hi>Abel</hi> and of <hi>Balak,</hi> from the Victims of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> being of the ſame kind with thoſe of <hi>Elijah,</hi> from the Hiſtorical and Poetical Writings of the moſt Ancient times, In which you have frequent mention of Sheep, Oxen, Goats, Turtles, Pigeons, Offer'd up in Sacrifice, and of the ſame or very like ſorts of Odours, Incenſe and Perfumes in the Heathen Temples, which were in uſe either in the high places, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Temple of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 1. More inſtances of a like Nature may be produced, but this, being ſo remarkable and being a complication of ſo many inſtances in one, is ſufficient to juſtify what I have affirmed, that many of thoſe Rites among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which had afterwards the Authority of a divine Law, did prevail among themſelves and other Nations long before the delivery of that Law; of which nature this very uſage, of which we are now diſcourſing, of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers raiſing up Seed to the Brother, ſeems to have been one, ſince we ſee plainly that in the Family of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was in uſe from the very beginning of it and was put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by <hi>Judah</hi> his immediate deſcendant,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98888:35"/> and that not as a new thing, but as a known and common practice in ſuch caſes, otherwiſe it could not be ſaid of <hi>Onan v.</hi> 9. that <hi>he knew the Seed ſhould not be his,</hi> if he had not known this by former Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and examples of a like nature, and by the deſign of ſuch marriages in caſe the Brother died without iſſue. The ſame thing appears likewiſe from that ſaying of <hi>Judah v. 26. She hath been more righteous than I.</hi> By which he plainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a right which <hi>Tamar</hi> had to the enjoyment of his youngeſt Son <hi>Shelah,</hi> which it was not in his power to deny her. It muſt therefore of neceſſity depend upon ſome known Law or uſage of thoſe and former times, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, it depended only upon his promiſe, <hi>v. 11. Then ſaid</hi> Judah <hi>to</hi> Tamar <hi>his Daughter in Law, remain a Widow at thy Fathers Houſe, till</hi> Shelah <hi>my Son be grown;</hi> which words do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly contain an implicit Promiſe, that when <hi>Shelah</hi> was come to mans eſtate, he ſhould be obliged to perform the Husbands part to raiſe up Seed to his Eldeſt Brother <hi>Er,</hi> and <hi>Tamars</hi> performing the condition on her own part, by puting on her Widows Garments, the better to avoid all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98888:36"/> to her Bed, as we ſee ſhe did, <hi>v.</hi> 14. makes this implicit obligation ſtill more binding upon <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo that he ſeems rather to be obliged by vertue of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary reſtraint which he by his promiſe had laid upon himſelf than by any antecedent Law.</p>
            <p>But to this I anſwer, that, though the inſtance of <hi>Shelah</hi> will not perhaps prove it to have been a Law, yet that of <hi>onan,</hi> the intermediate Brother between him and the Eldeſt, will; to which purpoſe it will be neceſſary for us to obſerve, that in the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where the degrees pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in marriage are recited, that of the Brothers Wife is prohibited with no leſs ſeverity than any of the reſt; the reaſon of which, together with the prohibition it ſelf, is expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>v. 16. Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of thy Brothers Wife, it is thy Brothers nakedneſs,</hi> that is, Man and Wife, in the very firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God himſelf, when our firſt Parents came together, were to be one Fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> the union betwixt them was to be ſo ſtrict and ſo inſeparable, as if they were both of them united into one and the ſame perſon, from whence it came to paſs that the Wiſe was accounted every whit as near, in the interpretation and eſteem
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98888:36"/> of Law, to all thoſe to whom ſhe was allyed by the affinity depending upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as the Husband himſelf was by thoſe degrees of Conſanguinity, in which he ſtood reſpectively to them before it.</p>
            <p>§ 2. This was the reaſon of all thoſe Laws, <hi>Levit. 18. 8. The nakedneſs of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wife ſhalt thou not uncover, it is thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedneſs. v. 14. Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of thy Fathers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou ſhalt not approach to his Wife, ſhe is thy Aunt.</hi> That is, Uncles and Aunts, great Uncles and great Aunts, and ſo all along in the Collateral Line, aſcend as high as you will, are in the interpretation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> as well as of the Civil Law <hi>Parentum loco,</hi> in the ſtead of Parents, and are to have the ſame or a like reſpect paid them by us, the ſame or a like Authority and rule over us, with our natural Fathers and Mothers, which are the very reaſons aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this and all further prohibitions in the directly or collaterally aſcending Lines by the Civil Laws of the Empire, which are neither of them any way conſiſtent with the conjugal familiarities of Man and Wife, ſo that to uncover the nakedneſs of a mans Uncle, is the ſame thing as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that of his Father, and the Uncle and Uncles Wife being both by the primitive
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98888:37"/> Inſtitution of God himſelf, conſidered as the ſame perſon, to marry with his Aunt is to commit Inceſt with his Mother. Again, <hi>v. 15. Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of thy Daughter-in-Law, ſhe is thy Sons Wife;</hi> that is, they are all one, and 'tis the ſame thing as if you ſhould uncover the nakedneſs of your own Daughter, and <hi>v. 17. Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of a Woman and her Daughter;</hi> becauſe the Woman is your ſelf and therefore her Daughter is yours; but then it follows: <hi>Neither ſhalt thou take her Sons Daughter, or her Daughters Daughter to uncover her nakedneſs,</hi> becauſe being united to the Mother from whom they are deſcended, He is by interpretation a Common Parent, as well as ſhe, to all that derive their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree from her Loyns.</p>
            <p>§ 3. This is ſufficient to ſhew, that by the firſt inſtitution of things, the Brothers Wife and the Brother are both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as the ſame, ſo that to uncover the nakedneſs of the Brothers Wife is, as the Law expreſſes it, to uncover the nakedneſs of the Brother himſelf, and conſequently the ſame thing as to marry a Man's own Siſter: Siſter and Brother Germans being, tho in different Sexes, the ſame degree of relation. It is clear therefore that, if to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98888:37"/> marry a Siſter German, or a Siſter Uterine were prohibited before the Law, then to marry the Brothers Wife, unleſs in the caſe before excepted, muſt be prohibited alſo, becauſe all theſe things depend upon that fundamental poſition, that Man and Wife are to be conſidered as the ſame perſon, which is as ancient as <hi>Adam,</hi> and depends upon no leſs Authority than that of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Now that to marry a Brother or Siſter German, (bateing the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matches between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> and their Siſters, which the ſame neceſſity that caus'd muſt excuſe) has been always look'd upon as unlawful, even before the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the delivery of the Law by him, I will prove by ſeveral arguments.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Firſt, Becauſe all the prohibited Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and Luſts, mentioned in the Chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi> above cited, are reckoned amongſt thoſe ſins which were the reaſons of Gods wrath amongſt the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the Ancient Inhabitants of the Land of <hi>Canaan v. 27. 28. For all theſe abominations have the men of the Land done, which were before you, and the Land is defiled: That the Lord ſpue not you out alſo, when ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file it, as</hi> he <hi>ſpued out the Nations that were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98888:38"/> before you.</hi> Again, <hi>v. 30. Therefore ſhall ye keep mine Ordinance, that ye commit not any of theſe abominable cuſtoms which were committed before you.</hi> and <hi>ch. 20. 23. And ye ſhall not walk in the manners of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I caſt out before you, for they committed all theſe things, and therefore I abhorred them.</hi> Wherefore there being no puniſhment inflicted but for ſin, nor any ſin againſt God that is not a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of ſome divine Law, nor any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law but what is either Natural or Poſitive, that is to ſay, revealed, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the marriage of the Siſter Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was an offence againſt one if not againſt both theſe Laws, before the <hi>Moſaick</hi> diſpenſation was of any force or Authority in the World.</p>
            <p>§ 6. And tho I am not ignorant, that ſome of the inſtances mentioned as forbidden, were notwithſtanding allow'd and practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the permiſſion of God himſelf in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; as in the caſe of marrying the half Siſter, or the Siſter by the Fathers ſide, which was <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe and yet is expreſly forbidden. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 9. yet that this of the Siſter German was not of that nature, I conjecture with great probability from the puniſhment annext to it as its ſanction. <hi>Lev. 20. 20. If a man ſhall take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98888:38"/> his Brothers Wife, it is an unclean thing, he hath uncovered his Brothers nakedneſs, they ſhall be Childleſs;</hi> that is, not that God would viſit them by a particular judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Barrenneſs, any more than in the other inſtances, mentioned in the ſame Chapter where all the puniſhments are all along inflicted by the hands of men, but it is meant, that they were immediately to be put to death, without giving them ſo long a Reprieve as to prolong their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory by their iſſue, they were to be utterly and totally cut off from their People, both in their own perſons and that of their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as it is <hi>v.</hi> 18. they were to <hi>die Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> as it is <hi>v.</hi> 20. and ſo the Seventy have likewiſe render'd it in this verſe, as well as in the former, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is the ſame thing with, <hi>they ſhall ſurely be put to death, v. 10. their blood ſhall be upon them, v. 11, 12, 13. he or they ſhall bear their iniquity, v.</hi> 17, 19. That is, there ſhall be no Atonement for them by any Sacrifice or ſin Offering, but they themſelves ſhall bear their own iniquity, and ſuffer death in their own proper perſons.</p>
            <p>§ 7. But now it is not at all likely, that that which was no offence before the Law, ſhould under it be thought ſo heinous that no Sacrifice, no Luſtration, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98888:39"/> no Expiation would be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the perſon offending muſt without mercy, without the leaſt reprieve or reſpite of his ſentence immediately ſuffer death: I conclude therefore, what I deſign to prove, that the marriage of the Brother to the Brothers Wife, and much more of the Brother to to the Siſter German was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and abominable in the ſight of God, before the promulgation of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, which is my firſt argument.</p>
            <p>§ 8. But then Secondly, That the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Brother and Siſter Germans, and conſequently of the Brother to the Brothers Wife, which I have already ſhewn to be the ſame, is unlawful, will be ſufficiently proved, if I can prove there was any ſuch thing as an inceſtuous or prohibited mixture before that time, which, beſides what has been ſaid of the <hi>Amorites</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Ancient Planters of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> I can prove by other inſtances both before and after the Floud.</p>
            <p>§ 9. And Firſt before it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. We find it thus writen. <hi>The Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of Men that they were fair, and they took them Wives of all which they choſe.</hi> that is, they made Intermarriages among one another, without any regard to the prohibited degrees of Conſanguinity,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98888:39"/> ſo that they made no ſcruple of marrying even their own Siſters, if they were ſuch as they could ſet their affections upon, which practice of theirs was ſo provoking to Almighty God, that it is ſaid in the next <hi>verſe, And the Lord ſaid, My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</hi> His days were immediately ſhortned upon it, and very ſoon after, upon the continuance of this and other, as it ſeemeth to me, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs horrid impieties, for this is only mention'd to ſet the more particular mark and brand upon it, that fatal Deluge hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by which the Old World, and all that was in it, Eight Perſons and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that were with them only excepted, was deſtroyed. Now that inceſtuous mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and particularly thoſe of Siſter and Brother are here underſtood, I prove thus.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Firſt, They took them Wives of all whom they <hi>choſe,</hi> therefore it muſt not be underſtood of any Rape or Violence, but it was the effect of <hi>choice</hi> which is an eaſy and gentle as well as a deliberat thing. Secondly, They took them <hi>Wives;</hi> which implyes not a ſudden Violence, but a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contract between the parties, by which they were obliged mutually to enter into a Matrimonial eſtate, and live at Bed and Board together.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98888:40"/>
            <p>And, which is a mighty confirmation of this interpretation, this is deſcribed as the ſtate and condition of the World juſt before the coming of the Floud, by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke. Mat. 24. 38, 39. Luk. 17. 27. They did Eat and Drink they married Wives and were given in marriage, untill the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Ark, and the Floud came and deſtroyed them all.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, 2 <hi>Pet. c. 2. v. 5, 6. God ſpared not the Old World, but ſaved</hi> Noah <hi>the Eighth perſon a, Preacher of Righteouſneſs, bringing in the Floud upon the World of the ungodly, and turning the Cities of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah <hi>into Aſhes, condemned them with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, making them an enſample unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly.</hi> What is meant moſt eſpecially in the latter <hi>verſe</hi> by the word <hi>ungodly</hi> we know very well from the Hiſtory of thoſe wicked places; but the Old World not being charged with ſo unnatural a crime, which yet it is very probable it would have been, had it been guilty of it, the beſt, as well as the moſt charitable, way of interpreting the ſame word in the former <hi>verſe,</hi> is by expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of inceſtuous mixtures which have always in the eſteem of the World been accounted the next in guilt to it.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98888:40"/>
            <p>§ 11. The ſame thing is likewiſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully confirmed from an expreſſion in the ſtory of <hi>Zelophehad, Num. 36. 6. Let them marry to whom they think beſt,</hi> which anſwers exactly to that other place in <hi>Gen. they took them Wives of all which they choſe,</hi> and is of the ſame import and ſignification: <hi>Let them marry into their own family, for the better preſervation of the inheritance,</hi> without regard to thoſe reſtrictions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have circumſcribed them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they all married to their Couſin Germans, which were yet in other caſes prohibited by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and by the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as I ſhall prove more largely in another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein I ſhall ſtate that whole caſe and ſhew, that as well by the Law of Chriſt, as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and not only ſo but by the Law of nature too, ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are <hi>ex antecedenti,</hi> unlawful, tho af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be conſummated by fruition, they are upon the ſame reaſons valid upon which before it they are prohibited and void.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Thus much may ſerve for the firſt part of what I undertook to prove, that the place in <hi>Geneſis</hi> above cited is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Inceſtuous Mixtures: I will now
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98888:41"/> ſhew that the Marriage of <hi>Siſters</hi> and <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Germans</hi> is chiefly, if not only, pointed at in this place, by this Syllogiſm.</p>
            <p>Either the Marriages both of Mothers and Siſters, with their Sons and Brethren is to be underſtood in this place, or of Siſters and Brothers only.</p>
            <p>But the Marriage of Mothers with their Sons is not at all pointed at in this place.</p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt of neceſſity be meant of the Marriage of Brothers and Siſters only.</p>
            <p>The Major I prove plainly from this, that all other degrees of Conſanguinity before the delivery of the Law were no obſtruction to Marriage, for of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Couſin Germans, we have an inſtance in <hi>Jacob,</hi> who married <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> his Uncle <hi>Labans</hi> Daughters, of the Aunt in <hi>Amram</hi> the Father of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, and of the half Siſter by the Fathers ſide, in <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. It remains therefore, ſince the very next degrees, both in the aſcending and in the collateral line were permitted that this Text cannot poſſibly be underſtood of any other Inceſtuous Marriages, but thoſe of Brothers and Siſters Germans, or of Sons and their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98888:41"/> natural Mothers together; but of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Sons with their Mothers, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to underſtand it, for this reaſon, that it is ſaid, <hi>the Sons of God ſaw the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men that they were fair,</hi> in which it is plainly implyed, that they were young and Virgins; at leaſt, thus much is true that the Epithet of <hi>fair,</hi> is by no means ſutable to Women in their declining Age, as they muſt needs be who are the Parents of marriageable Children; it is therefore evident that it muſt be meant of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage of Brothers and Siſters Germans together, which was the thing I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove.</p>
            <p>§ 13. And this being ſo great a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Almighty God, that it was one of the main cauſes of that diſmal Floud with which the Old World was overtaken, and it being inconſiſtent with the Juſtice of God, to puniſh an offence ſo heavily and ſo univerſally, which they themſelves who did it, did not know to be a ſin, it follows plainly that before the Floud ſuch Marriages were, and were accounted in the eſteem of the World, unlawful.</p>
            <p>§ 14. Having thus proved that before the Floud there were prohibited degrees of Conſanguinity, and that the tranſgreſſing thoſe bounds by Inceſtuous Mixtures, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98888:42"/> did then very frequently prevail in the World, was one great cauſe of that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal calamity with which it was overtaken; it may ſeem an unneceſſary task to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove, that the ſame prohibitions were eſteemed no leſs ſacred and inviolable after it, ſince <hi>Noah,</hi> who together with his Sons were innocent of this ſin, and yet knew ſo well as they did, by the puniſhment of others, how heavily diſpleaſing it was in the Eyes of God, could not chooſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the tradition of the Floud it ſelf, but deliver down the cauſes of it to their Poſterity, together with a caution to avoid the ſame iniquities, for fear of being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, tho not with the ſame (for God had made a promiſe that he would not drown the World any more) yet, with ſome equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrible and dreadful judgments.</p>
            <p>§ 15. But yet, becauſe nothing can be too ſure, I will prove it by a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by the firſt of which it will appear, that the marriage of Parents with their Children; by the ſecond, that that of Brothers and Siſters Germans or Uterines with one another, was after the Floud and before the delivery of the Law, look'd upon as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and unlawful.</p>
            <p>§ 16. The Firſt is the caſe of <hi>Lot,</hi> who lay with his Two Daughters, from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98888:42"/> which inceſtuous Coitions the two great people of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were deſcended; but they deſpaired of prevailing upon him to gratify their wicked deſires, till they had made him ſo much more than mellow, that it is ſaid, <hi>he perceived not when they lay down or when they aroſe, Gen.</hi> 19. 33. which is a plain argument that a juſt and righteous man, which is the Character of <hi>Lot,</hi> would not, in his right ſenſes and while he continued to have a due exerciſe of his reaſon, have been guilty of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of that nature, and conſequently that in thoſe times it was eſteemed and looked upon by all as an abominable and accurſed thing.</p>
            <p>§ 17. The Second inſtance is that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when being charged by <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> the King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> for having deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him under pretence that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his Siſter, when ſhe was in reality his Wife, ſays in excuſe of himſelf, <hi>Gen. 20. 12. She is my Siſter, ſhe is the Daughter of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not the Daughter of my Mother, and ſhe became my Wife,</hi> by which it is plain, that in the opinion of <hi>Abraham</hi> her being a Siſter only by the Fathers ſide, was not an hinderance to Marriage, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken by way of appeal, and in his own vindication to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> who had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98888:43"/> indeed injured himſelf, for want of duly conſidering the true meaning of <hi>Abrahams</hi> expreſſion, it is an argument that it was the Cuſtom of thoſe times, and that the ſame degrees of Conſanguinity were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prohibited at <hi>Gerar</hi> as well as in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who probably if in theſe matters he had differed from his neighbours, it would have been in this that the allowances would have been rather more narrow than more indulgent and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious on his ſide.</p>
            <p>§ 18. I know very well that <hi>Joſephus</hi> and out of him Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> and out of him his Tranſcriber, <hi>T. D.</hi> the Writer of a ſmall Treatiſe in behalf of the Marriage of Couſin Germans, will needs have <hi>Sarah</hi> not to have been <hi>Abrahams</hi> Siſter in that ſenſe in which we uſually take the word, but only his Niece, the Daughter of his Brother <hi>Haran,</hi> and the ſame with <hi>Iſcah, Gen.</hi> 11. 29. and this he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 84 of that little piece, will appear to any one who rightly conſiders the place; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whether I have rightly conſidered it or no, I am ſure I have conſidered it as well as I can, and I can find no ſuch thing in it, but <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Iſcah</hi> are both of them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the very ſame <hi>verſe,</hi> which it is not likely that it would have been done
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98888:43"/> without any mention of the change of the name, as is uſually done, or without ſo much as intimating that ſhe was called by both of theſe names, if they had been both of them one and the ſame perſon.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if a man would be underſtood of his half Siſter or his Siſter by the Fathers ſide, how could he expreſs himſelf more clearly than thus. <hi>She is my Siſter, ſhe is the Daughter of my Father, but not the Daughter of my Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again that very expreſſion, <hi>ſhe is the Daughter of my Father, but not the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my Mother,</hi> cannot without granting many precarious aſſertions, and ſuch as can no way be juſtifi'd, be underſtood of the Niece or Brothers Daughter, ſo, as the ſenſe of the place muſt at that rate, be this; She is the Daughter, or Grandchild of my Father <hi>Therah,</hi> but not of my Mother, but ſhe is his Grandchild by ſome other Wife, who was the Mother of <hi>Haran;</hi> ſo that it is plain to make this interpretation good, theſe two things muſt firſt be granted, Firſt, that <hi>Therah</hi> had two Wives, either together, which cannot be proved of any but <hi>Lamech</hi> before the Floud, or ſucceſſively, which cannot be proved neither; and if it could be proved yet, Secondly, it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe that of theſe two, <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98888:44"/> was the Son of the one, and <hi>Haran</hi> of the other, but that they were not both deſcended of the ſame Mother; all which is not only a ſhameleſs but alſo a very needleſs begging of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>For the reaſon, as I conceive, why this opinion was Firſt ſtarted in the World, was out of a pious deſign to defend <hi>Abraham</hi> from the Obloquy of an inceſtuous Mixture, whereas if a man would conſider things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the Niece or Brothers Daughter, is rather more than leſs a kin than the half Siſter by the Fathers ſide, and that upon two ſeveral accounts, both becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's is of the two, the more uncertain ſide, and becauſe in the Niece or Brothers Daughter, there is at one remove if he be Brother German, as it cannot be proved that <hi>Haran</hi> was not, the blood of both our Parents running in her veins, beſides that to ſuch an one we are <hi>parentum loco,</hi> which is another hindrance to Marriage in the <hi>Moſaick</hi> as well as the Civil Law,</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore upon an impartial ſurvey of the whole matter, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, let it be ſupported by never ſo great names, is not only precarious but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable into the bargain. Neither do we read of any other change of Name which <hi>Sarah</hi> ever ſuffered but only that of <hi>Sarai,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98888:44"/> by a very light mutation into <hi>Sarah,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Domina, Ductrix, Princeps Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> to make it of the ſame ſignification with <hi>Miriam</hi> or <hi>Maria,</hi> which was the Name of the bleſſed Virgin, from <hi>Mar</hi> or <hi>Maran Dominus,</hi> whence the <hi>Maronites</hi> in the Eaſt, and that bitter form of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication called by St. <hi>Paul Anathema Maranatha</hi> have their name likewiſe.</p>
            <p>For as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was A Type of Chriſt ſo what the bleſſed Virgin was to him, that <hi>Sarah</hi> was to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the reſpective Mothers of thoſe two bleſſed offsprings, the one an Old Woman with whom it had long ceaſed to be after the manner of Women, the other a ſpotleſs Virgin, that had never known man, both of them in a manner equally miraculous as hath been ſaid elſe where in the caſe of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt his forerunner.</p>
            <p>The Reſult of all is this, it hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved that for Brothers and Siſters Germans to marry, was all along account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impious and unlawful, it hath been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe, that the Marriage of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wife in all but the caſe excepted, is in the interpretation of Law the ſame thing, as to marry the Siſter German, laſtly, by the expreſs words of the Levitical Table of Marriage it appears that where the Brother
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98888:45"/> dying left Iſſue, at leaſt Male Iſſue begotten in lawful Wedlock, behind him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were puniſhable with death; which Puniſhment was too ſevere for the breach of a Law, that had not ſomewhat more than a poſitive turpitude in it, or of ſuch a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as was till that time without ſcruple allowed and practiced in the World.</p>
            <p>It is therefore clear upon more accounts than one, that ſuch marriages in general were always reckon'd inceſtuous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; <hi>Onan</hi> therefore being put upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſervice to the memory of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo much againſt his own inclinations, as we ſee by the ſtory it was, might have urged in his own excuſe, that it was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Mixture, forbidden by the Law of Nations, and the conſtant practice of thoſe and former times, and that though there be an entire Obedience due to the Commands of our Parents, as well as Politick Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſo far as thoſe Commands are in the matter of them Lawful, yet that in this, as in all other caſes, where the Divine and Human Authority interfere with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was better to obey God than Man, which ſince he did not do, but inſtead of that made a ſemblance of Obedience, though he was reſolved before hand not to do it, it is a plain indication that this caſe had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98888:45"/> been excepted by the uſage of thoſe times; neither is it likely that God would have puniſhed this diſobedience with that ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he did, if he had refuſed that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in compliance, or at leaſt in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Laws of God, or the Uſages, though but reputedly ſacred, of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>The ſame is likewiſe further clear from the apprehenſion of <hi>Judah,</hi> leſt the ſame untimely Fate might likewiſe be the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his youngeſt Son <hi>Shelah,</hi> if <hi>Tamar</hi> thorough his neglect did not continue in her ſtate of Widdow-hood, till <hi>Shelah</hi> was grown up to marriageable years, <hi>v. 11. leſt peradventure he dye alſo, as his Brethren did,</hi> which yet would have been no fault of his, if through the negligence of the Father a ſufficient reſtraint had not been laid upon his Daughter <hi>Tamar;</hi> neither could <hi>Shelah</hi> have ſuffer'd any thing by it, if it were not that God does often puniſh the ſins of the Fathers in the Children, which is no more than a proper exerciſe of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power and Dominion over men.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Judah</hi> had been guilty of no ſin, in ſuffering her to marry abroad, if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her marriage to <hi>Onan,</hi> Firſt, and of her being afterwards deſigned for <hi>Shelah,</hi> had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98888:46"/> not depended on ſomething elſe beſides his own arbitrary pleaſure. Further we do not find that ſhe was afterwards actually mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to <hi>Shelah,</hi> but it is more probable from the ſilence of the Scripture in it, that ſhe was not, becauſe by the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, which in this inſtance alſo ſeems to have been much ancienter than the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was not Lawful for the ſame Woman to conceive by the Father and Son. And, though it be true that ſhe did ſucceſſively enjoy both Son and Father, yet neither was this right in it ſelf, but only comparatively, &amp; is ſomewhat excuſed from a ſort of neceſſity that ſeem'd to attend it; <hi>She hath been more righteous then I,</hi> ſaid <hi>Judah,</hi> as much as to ſay, ſhe hath done an abominable thing, but I that which was more impious than ſhe, by with-holding my Son <hi>Shelah</hi> from her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, whom Cuſtom and my Promiſe, and the reſpect due to the memory of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Son, had given her for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and whom ſhe had purchaſed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition of Widdow-hood on her part, and by patiently expecting the time beforehand ſtipulated between them. Therefore he ſaid rightly, <hi>She hath been more righteous than I;</hi> for <hi>Er</hi> the Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brother was to raiſe up ſeed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or to propagate the name of <hi>Judah</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98888:46"/> himſelf, he dying with Iſſue, it was to be propagated by <hi>Onan</hi> and by <hi>Shelah</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies, which ſince the one did refuſe, and the other did either refuſe or was prohibited to do, what remained but that either the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Eldeſt Brother muſt periſh, or the Father himſelf perform the Husbands part, and propagate his own memory, and that of his Eldeſt Son deceaſed in his own perſon; which though in it ſelf deteſtable, yet the ſin was partly his own, in putting ſomething that looked like a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon the Woman; and it being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to an intention not only leſs culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the action it ſelf, but alſo ſuch as was laudable and juſt, though unjuſt to compaſs it by this means, it is for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſaith, <hi>She hath been more righteous then I.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Druſ. in loc. Juſta eſt quam ego; quomodo juſta quae ſe adulterio temeraverat? Non dicit justa ſimpliciter, ſed justa quam ego &amp; eſt ſenſus magis quam ego, i. e. juſtior. <hi>Comparativè</hi> igitur juſta erat.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly the ſame thing is evident from this, that till <hi>Judah</hi> was rightly informed of the matter, he would have burnt his Daughter <hi>Tamar</hi> for an Adultereſs, as having after a promiſe not to do it, by forſaking <hi>Shelah,</hi> adulterouſly betray'd the Bed of her Husband <hi>Er,</hi> by which you ſee likewiſe, which is an other confirmation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98888:47"/> of what hath been ſaid, that Adultery long before the delivery of the Law was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Death but it does not ſeem that he would have puniſhed this offence ſo heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Cuſtom and Law of that time, had not made it Adultery to marry or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy another ſo long as any of the Brethren ſtill remained alive, and in a Condition or likelyhood of being ſo, to propagate the name of their Elder Brother.</p>
            <p>It remains then that this Cuſtom muſt needs be ancienter than the time of <hi>Judah;</hi> and ſince there is no inſtance of any ſuch thing in all the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though you go as high as to <hi>Sem</hi> himſelf, till you come to the Sons of <hi>Judah</hi> in this Chapter, ſince all the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> were actually married at one and the ſame time to ſeveral and diſtinct Wives Since <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf is no where taken notice of as the beginner of any ſuch practice, or as an example of it it ſeems moſt reaſonable to go yet further backwards and place the firſt beginnings of this Ancient uſage in the ante-noachioal or ante-diluvian times.</p>
            <p>I will not deſend this fact of <hi>Tamar,</hi> from all ſuſpition of guilt, when it may ſeem to be at firſt ſight, not only a very unlawful but a very deteſtable practice and when at this diſtance of ſeveral Thouſand Years being in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98888:47"/> a manner perfectly unacquainted with the uſages of thoſe times, it is utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to make ſuch a Judgment of the caſe, as may be reli'd upon for truth in all its parts.</p>
            <p>But thus much I will ſay, ſhe was not by ſo doing guilty of Adultery, though whether ſhe were of Inceſt or no, will require ſome further conſideration; for either <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> the Third Son of <hi>Judah</hi> was alive, or he was dead; if he were alive, it is true ſhe was engaged to expect the years of his Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he might perform the Husbands part, in raiſing up Seed to his deceaſed Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by not expecting that appointed time, ſhe did in effect betray the Bed of her firſt Husband <hi>Er,</hi> whoſe perſon <hi>Shelah</hi> was in this caſe to ſuſtain. But if after ſhe had ſtaid thus long, which was all that ſhe was obliged to do, ſhe did then demand him in Marriage, according to the contract and agreement formerly made between them; if <hi>Judah</hi> who was to receive all the benefit of this agreement, which was the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his own and his Sons name, and the continuing the Inheritance in the line of the Firſt born, would not ſtand to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract into which he had entred for his own advantage, by all the Law, and all the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the World, the party to whom no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98888:48"/> benefit accrews is free of any further obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which was exactly <hi>Thamars</hi> caſe, to whom it might be indifferent, whether ſhe continued in the ſame houſe, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into another, and who might perhaps fancy ſome other perſon for her Husband more than ſhe did <hi>Shelah,</hi> in which caſe it is altogether unreaſonable ſhe ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any reſtraint, when the parties on whoſe ſide all the advantage lies, will not make good their own part of the bargain.</p>
            <p>It is clear then ſhe could not be guilty of Adultery upon ſuppoſition that <hi>Shelah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, had himſelf refuſed, or had by ſome external force been hindred from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his part of the condition, which it was impoſſible for him at that time to do, without his Fathers conſent, who had, as it ſeems, according to the Ancient practice of the firſt, mortals <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis,</hi> an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and deſpotical power over all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and dependants, as appears by the ſentence paſſed upon <hi>Tamar</hi> without any other Proceſs or Formality of Law, but his own Arbitrary decree, <hi>Gen. 38. 24. bring her forth and let her be burnt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which deſpotical power of Parents over their Children and ſuch was <hi>Tamar</hi> in this caſe, being ſtill conſidered as the Wife of her firſt Husband <hi>Er,</hi> the Son of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98888:48"/> 
               <hi>Judah</hi> ſo long as <hi>Shelah</hi> lived, who was when he came to Age to ſuſtain his perſon, and propagate his name) we have two known inſtances in the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, the firſt is that of him of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving <hi>Horatii,</hi> who killed his own Siſter, for bewailing the Death of her Lover, an enemy of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being for this fact ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and about to receive ſentence of Condemnation from the <hi>Duumviri,</hi> who ſat in Judgment upon him, was thus defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and interceeded for by the miſerable old man his Father, who was now in danger of loſing all his Children, though not many hours before, the happy Parent of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hopeful Offspring, <hi>Se Filiam jure caeſam judicare, ni ita eſſet patrio jure in filium animadverſurum fuiſſe.</hi> Liv. lib. 1. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is of <hi>Sp. Caſſius</hi> in the Second Book of the ſame Author, who being accuſed of aſpiring to be King, a name ſo hated at that time by the <hi>Romans,</hi> among other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given of his puniſhment, is ſaid to have been ſentenced to Death for it by his Father, and executed at home by vertue of that Sentence. <hi>Livies</hi> words are theſe: <hi>Sunt qui patrem auctorem ejus Supplicii ferant, eum, cognitâ domi causâ, verberàſſe ac ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câſſe: peculium<expan>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98888:49"/> CASSIA FAMILIA DAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M.</hi> And not unlike to this and the former inſtance is that of L. <hi>Virginius,</hi> in the <hi>3d.</hi> Book of the ſame Writer, who, as it may ſeem by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this paternal power, ſlew his own Daughter, to free her from the Luſt of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> the <hi>Decemvir,</hi> but as for the ſtory of <hi>Manlius,</hi> it being rather an effect of Military Diſcipline than his Authority, as a Father, it is not here to be accounted for.</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be doubted, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were beholding for the exerciſe of this Paternal Right, to ſome other People, both more <hi>Ancient</hi> and more <hi>Eaſterly</hi> from whom they were deſcended, both becauſe we have here a plain inſtance of the ſame Authority, inveſted in the perſon of <hi>Judah,</hi> and becauſe in the beginning of things, when almoſt every diſtinct Family was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Kingdom by it ſelf, of which the <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>familias</hi> was the Supreme Lord, from whoſe determinations there was no manner of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, it muſt needs be for the keeping this Family in due Order, there muſt be the ſame diſtinction of puniſhments according to the different natures, and differing ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of Offences, as are to be met with in greater Bodies; and in truth when matters are examin'd to the bottom it will be found, that the Original of all Juſtice,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98888:49"/> as well as Goverment, is from private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; but enough of this.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears that whether <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> refuſed to comply himſelf, or whether an outward reſtraint were laid upon him by his Father, the firſt of which ſeems to have been the very truth, it is the ſame caſe, and ſhe is either way freed from all manner of obligation, and conſequently could not be guilty of Adultery by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of another.</p>
            <p>Or elſe Secondly if you ſuppoſe <hi>Shelah</hi> to have been dead before this happened, then ſhe ſeems ſtill to be more excuſable, in that all the Brothers being dead one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, there was no body now left to raiſe up Seed to the Eldeſt, therefore he was perfectly dead to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, both in himſelf and in his Proxies, and ſo there was no poſſibility of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Adultery with relation either to him or them.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed according to the practice of after days, which ſeem to have taken their Coppy from theſe, and thoſe that went before them, in default of a Brother, the Widdow of the deceaſed might challenge the next of Kin, as is clear from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Ruth,</hi> who firſt demanded a <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Kinſman,</hi> and then upon his refuſal <hi>Boaz</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98888:50"/> in Marriage, the latter of which challenges was accepted.</p>
            <p>And though it ſeems clear in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> at leaſt as to an immediate Brother, that the Woman was bound to put in her Claim to him, yet it was ſtill at his liberty whether he would comply with it or no, only it ſeems by the inſtance of the neareſt of Kin in the family of <hi>Elimelech,</hi> in the ſtory of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> that he was to give ſome tolerable reaſon of ſuch his refuſal.</p>
            <p>But then again there be two reaſons why ſuch challenges as theſe were made; The firſt was this, That the Younger was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Nature of a Servant to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of which I ſhall ſpeak more largely by and by, but this did not hold in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Relations, who were not under the ſame ſubjection to the party deceaſed, nor to the deſpotical Authority of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-familias</hi> who was in the Nature of a common Soveraign to all the Sons, but had no ſuch power over the deſcending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the tranſverſe or oblique Line.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It was done for the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Inheritance in the Line of the Firſt-born, for which reaſon the Firſt-born of this imputative Wedlock, was to riſe up in, and inherit the name of the deceaſed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98888:50"/> that is, not that he was to be called by the ſame name with his imputative Father, for the Son of <hi>Ruth</hi> by <hi>Boaz,</hi> was not called <hi>Mahlon,</hi> which was the name of her decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Husband, but <hi>Obed;</hi> only all the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was, he was to inherit the eſtate of the deceaſed, which it was not in the power of his real Father to alienate from him, or divide among the Children of another <hi>Venter,</hi> neither had he any right to ſuch Inheritance, but what was devolved upon him by his Elder Brother for the uſe of his Eldeſt Son, by his ſaid Brothers Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him in his Brothers ſtead.</p>
            <p>It is apparent therefore, if there were no inheritance in danger of being alienated from the Houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> or of his Eldeſt Son, <hi>Er,</hi> that ſhe had no manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe ſhould challenge the <hi>next</hi> of <hi>Kin</hi> upon the deceaſe of the three Brothers, and therefore clear that ſhe did not do it, much leſs would any of them be under any the leaſt obligation to accept of any ſuch challenge as that was.</p>
            <p>For that <hi>Judah</hi> and much leſs his Eldeſt Son, had yet no Inheritance of their own, may ſeem probable from this, that <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf was yet alive, beſides that they ſhortly after were to part for <hi>Egypt,</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a long Adieu to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98888:51"/> and all their immovable Poſſeſſions in it. However <hi>Judah</hi> himſelf being ſtill as we ſee by the ſtory in a condition capable of leaving a Poſterity deſcended immediately from his own Loyns, it was a prepoſterous way to have recourſe to this artificial remedy in the tranſverſe Line, when Nature as yet was ſo vigorous and warm as to be able to propagate and continue its ſelf; ſo that it remains an undeniable truth, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Shelah</hi> were alive or dead, ſhe was free from all manner of Obligation either to him or any other of that Family, and therefore could not by this Action be ſaid to have committed Adultery, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>But now after all it is certain that <hi>Shelah</hi> was yet alive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 12. <hi>The Sons of</hi> Judah, Er, Onan, <hi>and</hi> Shelah, Pharez <hi>and</hi> Zerah: <hi>but</hi> Er <hi>and</hi> Onan <hi>dyed in the Land of</hi> Canaan. Which is as much as to ſay that <hi>Shelah</hi> did not but went along with his Father, Grand-father, and Uncles into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it is alſo, <hi>Num.</hi> 26. 19, 20. <hi>The Sons of</hi> Judah <hi>after their Families were of</hi> Shelah <hi>the Family of the</hi> Shelanites, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Chron. 4. 21. 22, the Sons of</hi> Shelah <hi>the Son of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>were,</hi> Er, <hi>the Father of</hi> Lecah, <hi>and</hi> Laadah <hi>the Father of</hi> Mareſhah, <hi>and the Families of them that wrought fine Linen, of the Houſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98888:51"/> of</hi> Aſhbea. <hi>And</hi> Jochim <hi>and the men of</hi> Chozeba, <hi>and</hi> Joaſh, <hi>and</hi> Saraph, <hi>who had the dominion of</hi> Moab, <hi>and</hi> Jaſhubi-lehem. For this reaſon it is that <hi>Joſephus</hi> reckoning up the Sons of <hi>Judah</hi> does not mention the two Eldeſt <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> becauſe they dyed without Iſſue, but only <hi>Shelah</hi> the Youngeſt of the Three by his Lawful Wife <hi>Shua,</hi> and <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zerah</hi> begotten by him upon his Daughter in Law <hi>Tamar,</hi> his words are theſe <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. and it ſeems from this place of <hi>Joſephus</hi> very probable, that ſuch as dyed without Iſſue, their names were blotted out of the <hi>Genealogical Tables</hi> of the <hi>Jews;</hi> which is not only reaſonable in it ſelf to ſuppoſe, there being no uſe of ſuch names in Tables of Genealogy, as do not ſpread themſelves farther by a Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their own, but it will alſo if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted give a marvellous light to ſeveral places of Scripture, not yet ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as that of <hi>Exod. 32. 32. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their Sin, and if not, blot me I pray thee out of thy Book which thou haſt written.</hi> Not that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuppoſed any ſuch thing, as that God kept a Scroul of Parchment, or a material or literal Book, wherein he did enter down the Names of thoſe, on whom he was pleaſed to beſtow
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98888:52"/> any mark of his favour, but it is manifeſtly a Metaphorical expreſſion, and therefore muſt allude to ſome Cuſtom or Uſage of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>Now it is certain that Tables of Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy were conſtantly kept, I will not ſay from the Creation, when there were no letters, but as ſoon as ever letters began, this being the Principal if not the firſt uſe of Letters in all Nations. To what wherefore can this expreſſion better allude than to thoſe Tables? which being probably writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over in every Family for themſelves, when the Family increaſed, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Tables were to be enlarged, and often-times Tranſcribed for the uſe of new deſcendants in every Generation, they did not Tranſcribe any more than what was neceſſary to carry down the Hiſtory of Succeſſion, ſo as if a man had Five Sons as <hi>Judah</hi> had, Two of which dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, and ended in themſelves, they were omitted as uſeleſs out of this Table, becauſe the knowledge of their names was of no uſe to the <hi>Herauldry,</hi> as I may call it, of thoſe times, which could give a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent account of its ſelf without them, but could not make uſe of them in order to the ſetling any doubt that ſhould ariſe in the Hiſtory of a Pedigree in after times.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:98888:52"/>
            <p>Of the ſame import is that of <hi>Pſalm 69. 28. Let them be blotted out of the Book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</hi> The Book of Genealogies is called the <hi>Book of the Living</hi> becauſe in them their names abide for ever, and they live in their Poſterity, though in their own perſons they be dead and buried. And <hi>not written with the righteous,</hi> becauſe fruitfulneſs was always look'd upon among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that with good reaſon, as an argument of Gods favour, and of ſomething commendable in thoſe on whom this bleſſing was beſtowed, and the contrary as a curſe of God, for ſome one or more very heinous and provoking ſins, which was manifeſtly the caſe of <hi>Er,</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> who ſeem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have been left out of <hi>Joſephus</hi> his account, as not worthy the notice of after times.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Pſ. 109. 13. Let his Poſterity be cut off, and in the Generation following let their name be blotted out,</hi> i. e. when the next Generation, ſhall come again to Tranſcribe the Tables of Genealogy for themſelves, let the names of this mans Poſterity, as dying without Iſſue be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And this no queſtion is the true ſenſe of that place, <hi>Deut. 25. 6. And it ſhall be that the Firſt-born which ſhe beareth ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98888:53"/> in the name of his Brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Iſrael. Put out,</hi> viz. in that manner which I have ſaid, and that in the Regiſter of his Family his name may ſtill ſtand over his imputative Offspring; which it was neceſſary it ſhould do, becauſe all the deſcendants from that adoptive Birth, enjoyed the Inheritance only in right of him, who himſelf died without any Iſſue of his own Body; ſo that if his name were left out of the Tables, the Eſtate would upon any controverſy, be adjudged to ſome Collateral pretender, becauſe his imputative deſcent in a right Line of adoption could not be proved; therefore it was neceſſary it ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered down thus:</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>Mahlon</item>

                  <item>Obed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Or ſome ſuch way as this, to ſhew how he and his deſcendants came by that Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which they enjoyed, otherwiſe he that died unmarried or being married had no Inheritance, nor Iſſue either of his own or his Proxy, his name was omitted as uſeleſs in the Catalogues of Succeſſion.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98888:53"/>
            <p>It is out of diſpute then that <hi>Shelah</hi> was yet ſurviving, it is likewiſe certain that he was now come to Marriageable Eſtate. <hi>v. 14. She ſaw that</hi> Shelah <hi>was grown and ſhe was not given him to Wife.</hi> and <hi>v. 26. She hath been more righteous than I, becauſe that I gave her not to</hi> Shelah <hi>my Son.</hi> So that all the remaining Queſtion is, why he did not give her, which Queſtion in all likelyhood muſt be Anſwered thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Onan</hi> had ſuch ſuch an averſation for the perſon of <hi>Tamar,</hi> or rather for the thoughts of getting Children to propagate the name, or enjoy the inheritance, if he had any, of another, that we ſee what prodigious brutality he was guilty of, to decline this ungrateful Service, and it is not unlikely that <hi>Shelah,</hi> when he came at Age, might as to this matter have the ſame ſentiments with his Brother <hi>Onan,</hi> for it is natural to every man to hate Bondage, and to loath every thing that beſpeaks him a Slave, which was the true reaſon of the Younger Brothers, performing the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands part to continue the name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Elder, as I ſhall prove more largely in its due place.</p>
            <p>It is very likely therefore, that knowing how ſeverely God had puniſhed the beaſtly diſſimulation of his Elder Brother, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98888:54"/> very fact it ſelf being made death after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is a new argument of the great Antiquity of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> diſpenſation, as to moſt of the things Prohibited or Commanded in it; it is very likely, I ſay, upon this account, that having the ſame averſion with his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, he would not yet be guilty of the ſame ſoul Hypocriſy and Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but declined this ungrateful office more openly than his Brother had done, to which though his Father by his Arbitrary power might have compelled him, as he ſeems to have done his Son <hi>Onan,</hi> yet fearing to drive him to the ſame wicked extremity which had coſt the other his life, and would in concluſion rob him of all his Children, he did ſo far at laſt yield to the fixt and immovable averſion of his Son, as to ſuffer him to Marry another, for Marry it is certain he did, as I have proved already, and from that match the <hi>Shelanires</hi> were deſcended.</p>
            <p>Beſides that <hi>Tamar</hi> would have had no reaſon to deſpair, which yet it is certain ſhe did, <hi>v.</hi> 14. If <hi>Shelah</hi> had ſtill continued perfectly diſengaged, for ſo long whatever his own inclinations were, ſhe had a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground of hope, that he was ſtill by his Father <hi>Judah</hi> deſigned for her, in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98888:54"/> purſuance of the agreement made between them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. The ſame is clear from <hi>v. 26. Becauſe that I gave her not to</hi> Shelah <hi>my Son,</hi> for if he had remained ſtill unmarryed, and had been firmly deſigned by <hi>Judah</hi> for her Bed, it would have been no excuſe for her, that he had not done it yet, ſo long as he had not violated his faith by giving him to another.</p>
            <p>It is certain therefore that <hi>Shelah</hi> was not only alive at this time but actually Marryed, and being ſo he had ſtill a further excuſe why he would not raiſe up Seed to his Brother.</p>
            <p>Becauſe beſides his own averſion, which would to be ſure encreaſe, with the love which he may well be ſuppoſed to have conceived for his other Wife, the piques and animoſities betwixt the two Women might make it a duty which he owed to the quiet of his Family and the comfort of his Life, to continue with the ſame or greater obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy to refuſe her, than he had formerly done; nay, the rational proſpect of thoſe differences which do naturally ariſe in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies from <hi>Poligamy,</hi> where there are more Women than one pretending at the ſame time to an equal or greater ſhare in the affections of the Husband, and in the Government of the Houſe, together with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98888:55"/> the quarrels and little janglings of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective broods, which might in time grow up to a mortal enmity betwixt them and their Families for ever; in all which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences the Mothers would be ſure to ſide with their reſpective Offsprings, and would engage all the Servants under them to take their parts, by which means the whole Family would be engaged in a kind of <hi>Civil</hi> War, and would be embroyled in everlaſting Tumults and Diſorders; this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone might be ſufficient to deter him from admitting <hi>Tamar</hi> into the partnerſhip of his Bed, and much more would the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which he might poſſibly have of the inconveniences that had actually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, ſcare him from admitting any rival in his love, or partner in his conjugal embraces.</p>
            <p>Though in truth whether it were from theſe unfortunate janglings, or that in thoſe times it was not looked upon as lawful, the inſtances of <hi>Poligamy</hi> before the Law, are very rarely to be met with: I do not remember to have found above one before the Floud, and that is of <hi>Lamech</hi> who had <hi>Adah</hi> and <hi>Zillah</hi> to his Wives at one and the ſame time, and but two after it, and before the delivery of the Law, that is, of <hi>Jacob</hi> who had <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98888:55"/> Daughters of his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> and of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> who had Three Wives, but Two were ſuch as it was not Lawful for any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Poſterity to marry, for which reaſon, they are ſaid to have been <hi>a grief of mind to</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Rebekah <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 35. upon which account it is moſt probable that he afterwards married <hi>Mahalath</hi> the Daughter of his Uncle <hi>Iſhmael, Gen.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 28. 9. only to reconcile himſelf to his offended Parents.</p>
            <p>How the firſt of theſe agreed we cannot tell, but it is probable bad enough, from what has been ſaid already; and whether that <hi>Homicid</hi> which was committed by <hi>Lamech</hi> were not the effect of ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh quarrel, may rather be ſuſpected at this diſtance of time than proved, but ſomething ſure was the matter, which made him ſo pathetically apply himſelf to them, as if they had been ſome way or other concerned in it, <hi>Gen. 4. 23. And Lamech ſaid unto his Wives</hi> Adah <hi>and</hi> Zil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, <hi>hear my voice ye Wives of</hi> Lamech, <hi>hearken unto my ſpeech, for I have ſlain a Man to my wounding and a Young man to my hurt.</hi> And as for the laſt of them, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, to all that are not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with the Scripture ſtory.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98888:56"/> Wherefore <hi>Shelah</hi> being now Married to another, he had now the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Poligamy</hi> to repreſent in his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, which is in its ſelf, and has been always accounted a very reaſonable excuſe, as in the caſe of the neareſt of Kin of the Family of <hi>Elimelech,</hi> his excuſe why he would not purchaſe the Field of <hi>Naomi,</hi> nor redeem the Inheritance of <hi>Mahlon</hi> and <hi>Chilion</hi> is this, <hi>I cannot redeem it my ſelf, leſt I marr my own Inheritance, Ruth</hi> 4. 6. But how comes that to paſs? <hi>Joſephus</hi> will tell you. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he ſaid he had a Wife and Children already.</hi> Which whether it were the Anſwer that he gave or no, yet it would have been ridiculous in <hi>Joſephus</hi> to repreſent him ſpeaking thus, if this had not been looked upon as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable excuſe, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and a proper Bar to Marriages of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Again it ſeems very probable that this was the very Anſwer, or ſubſtance of the Anſwer which he gave, becauſe this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is a very genuine interpretation of the place in <hi>Ruth</hi> above cited. <hi>I cannot redeem it my ſelf, leſt I marr my own Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are two ways by which the Inheritance might be marred, Firſt if there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98888:56"/> were a Morgage on the field of <hi>Naomi,</hi> or the Inheritance of <hi>Chilion,</hi> which Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage could not be wrought off without making a <hi>Verſura</hi> and turning the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience upon his own Eſtate, which yet in the end would come all to a caſe; for in the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> this incumbrance would be taken off, and in the mean time it would have been a very hard bargain, if the land which he had cleared would not more than anſwer the inconvenience of that which he had morgaged. Neither was it reaſonable that the Eldeſt Son of this <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious</hi> Bed, ſhould enjoy the entire Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of his <hi>reputed</hi> Father when he came at Age, ſuppoſing the <hi>Jubilee</hi> did not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before that time, till the debts of his <hi>real</hi> Parent contracted by this Marriage were ſatisfied. But this at the long run would be ſo far from an inconvenience if a man had no Wife before, that it would rather be a very great advantage, becauſe by this means there would be one Child pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and his own Eſtate left entire to make proviſion for the reſt.</p>
            <p>It is therefore neceſſary what <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath repreſented, that you ſuppoſe him to have been Married before, and then indeed beſides the inconveniencies of <hi>Polygamy,</hi> there would be this detriment accrue to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98888:57"/> his own inheritance; That the firſt Child enjoying the whole fortune of the reputed Father, all the reſt were looked upon as his <hi>own</hi> Offspring, by which means it would come to paſs that out of the ſame fortune, and that perhaps not very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neither; he would have two Wives, and two diſtinct broods of Children to make proviſion for.</p>
            <p>If the buſineſs of Polygamy had not been a lawful barr againſt Marriages of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when the party challenged was not inclinable to comply, it would have been in a manner impoſſible, conſidering the great Antiquity of this uſage, which I have already cleared, but we muſt have had more inſtances of Polygamy before the Law than are to be found in Scripture, whereas there are but three in all, one of which ſeems to me to labour under the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a much fowler occaſion, the other has been proved to be unlawful, and the laſt was a matter of neceſſity not choice, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the treachery of <hi>Laban,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true meaning and intention of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far therefore <hi>Joſephus</hi> is in the right, but yet there is one thing in which no queſtion he is much out of the way: his words are theſe, in the very ſame <hi>Paragraph</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98888:57"/> from whence I have taken the former; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That is, Boaz <hi>ſending firſt for</hi> Ruth, <hi>and then for him who was neareſt of Kin of the Family of</hi> Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech, <hi>asked him this queſtion, doſt thou poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs or occupy the Inheritance of</hi> Abimelech <hi>and his Sons? yes, ſaid he, I do, as being next of Kin. Nay, but ſaid</hi> Boaz, <hi>we muſt not obſerve the Law by halves; Therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave the Inheritance, or take this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with it (to raiſe up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance) at which words he immediately quitted his pretenſions both to the Woman and the Inheritance to</hi> Boaz <hi>who was himſelf a Kin to the Deceaſed.</hi> Which is without doubt a very great error of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus.</hi> For either the neareſt of Kin to the Houſe of <hi>Elimelech,</hi> or of <hi>Abimelech</hi> as he calls him, was legally poſſeſſed of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, or not; if he was why could he not ſtill enjoy it without the Woman; if he was not, unleſs upon this condition,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98888:58"/> how came he to enjoy it ſo long without diſturbance already, for an illegal poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in effect no poſſeſſion at all, unleſs what we have acquired by injuſtice we can maintain by force of Arms; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for <hi>Joſephus</hi> or any body for him to anſwer this.</p>
            <p>But beſides it is a flat contradiction to the expreſs words of Scripture; <hi>I cannot redeem it of my ſelf, leſt I marr my own Inheritance.</hi> But what need he redeem it if he had it in poſſeſſion already, and if he might enjoy it, as according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> he did, without redemption, I do not underſtand how the acquiſition of a new Eſtate, is any marr, prejudice, or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the old. I conclude therefore that <hi>Joſephus</hi> has miſinterpreted the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo I paſs on to that which is yet behind, on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>And I think it is very clear from what hath been ſaid, that <hi>Thamar</hi> having pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expected the time ſtipulated between <hi>Judah</hi> and her ſelf, and having in vain demanded <hi>Shelah</hi> for her Husband, in purſuance of that agreement and bargain, <hi>Shelah</hi> being reſolved not to comply, and <hi>Judah</hi> not to compel him to it, it was now morally impoſſible that this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ever have its effect, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98888:58"/> Moral Impoſſibility is a ſufficient Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Thamar</hi> from the charge of Adultery. Beſides that <hi>Judah</hi> having firſt violated his promiſe, ſhe would at the worſt have been <hi>more righteous than he,</hi> as he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
            <p>But yet after all this though <hi>Shelah</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill averſe, and <hi>Judah</hi> in the ſame mind that he would put no arbitrary Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon his inclination, yet it is certain he ſtill continued to perſuade him what he could to accept of <hi>Thamar</hi> for his Wife, and that not without ſome though but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hopes of prevailing upon him by his importunity, though he could not as yet alter his inclination, otherwiſe there could be no colour of condemning her for an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs,</hi> which yet it is certain he did, for by <hi>Whoredom</hi> in the Text is not meant <hi>ſimple Fornication</hi> a very trivial crime in thoſe days, but <hi>Adultery,</hi> or the betraying of a Conjugal and Lawful Bed. As is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from this that <hi>Judah</hi> himſelf was guilty of the former, and as it proved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Story, at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> and with the <hi>ſame Perſon;</hi> but it would have been a very unequal thing to puniſh that fault with death in another, of which he himſelf was guilty. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he ſtill continued to importune
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98888:59"/> his Son to accept of her, and that it was upon this account, and no other he laid <hi>Adultery</hi> to her charge, though when he more calmly conſidered the Circumſtances on her ſide, how much ſhe had been abuſed by himſelf, and how good reaſon ſhe had to deſpair of ever obtaining <hi>Shelah,</hi> he then withdrew his Action, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth; <hi>She hath been more righteous than I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I demonſtrated my way by a very faint and dim light, thorough all the dark paſſages of an ancient and obſcure Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which whoever ſhall conſider ſo well as I have done, muſt be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have not failed in any Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of repreſenting the very matter of fact, as it ſtood in thoſe times with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the parties concern'd.</p>
            <p>I could now be glad having waſh'd off the imputation of <hi>Adultery,</hi> if I could wipe out that of <hi>Inceſt</hi> too, not ſo much out of reſpect to the perſons of <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>Thamar</hi> conſidered by themſelves, as becauſe our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Genealogy is ſo deeply concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, and yet <hi>Thamar</hi> is no where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that I know of with any reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by any of the Writers either of the Old or New Teſtament, neither is this all but there are other inſtances in the ſame
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98888:59"/> Genealogy, partly of an equally foul na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with this, and partly of a nature ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing approaching to it.</p>
            <p>Of the latter ſort are the Matches of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with his <hi>Half-Siſter,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob</hi> with his <hi>two Couſin Germans,</hi> both of them <hi>Siſter Germans</hi> to one another, but of theſe I ſhall give a fair account, when I come to ſpeak of the Marriages of <hi>Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which will be the ſubject of another Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt ſort is the inceſtuous congreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Lot</hi> with his two Daughters from whence <hi>Moab</hi> and conſequently our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf by <hi>Ruth</hi> a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Woman was deſcended, and the Marriage of <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the Wife of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> in which there was an horrid combination of <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> together, and yet from thence <hi>Solomon</hi> who was himſelf no very virtuous Prince, and from him many very wicked Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ſprung, in all whoſe Loins the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was contain'd, ſo that it may be applied to this ſenſe as well as any other, in reſpect of his Genealogy as well as for any other reaſon, what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath ſaid of him <hi>Eſai. 53. 12. He was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with Tranſgreſſours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all it is certain that the very worſt of theſe Congreſſions, had ſomething
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98888:60"/> in them which was Typical of that <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was to ſpring from them. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance firſt in that of <hi>Lot,</hi> with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mother of <hi>Moab</hi> from whom the whole people of the <hi>Moabites</hi> borrowed their Original; and why was he called <hi>Moab</hi> I beſeech you? was it not <hi>Miab?</hi> becauſe he was deſcended of <hi>his</hi> and his <hi>Mothers</hi> common <hi>Father,</hi> the Progenitor of him according to the Fleſh, who was begotten of his <hi>Father</hi> before all worlds, begotten of him who was the <hi>Father of the World,</hi> the <hi>Father of the Son,</hi> and though not in the ſame immediate ſenſe, the <hi>Father</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> his <hi>Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will inſtance likewiſe in the inceſtuous Mixture of <hi>Judah</hi> with his Daughter in Law <hi>Thamar,</hi> betwixt whom <hi>Pharez,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Progenitors was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and who was this <hi>Pharez,</hi> is it not from <hi>Pharats</hi> rupit? and does he not in his very name point at the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was in the fulneſs of time to be deſcended from his Loyns, by whom the <hi>Moſaick</hi> encloſure was to be laid open, and the <hi>Partition Wall</hi> betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> to be broken down?</p>
            <p>Laſtly in the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> with <hi>Ruth,</hi> which though it was not an inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet it was poſſibly an unlawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98888:60"/> Firſt of <hi>Mahlon,</hi> then of <hi>Boaz</hi> in his right to a <hi>ſtrainge Woman;</hi> and yet what more plain, than that the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> to <hi>Ruth</hi> a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was Typical of that bleſſed Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and of their being one Sheep-fold under one common Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, to which the diſpenſation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is ſo Naturally fitted, which was the deſign of his comming into the World, and of his Suffering upon the Croſs, and which though not yet compleated, yet the Completion of it, is by all good Chriſtians expected with a no leſs firm and conſident aſſurance, than that with which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any other part of the Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</p>
            <p>He was to unite <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the <hi>Humanity</hi> twiſted into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon with his <hi>God-head,</hi> he was to unite <hi>men</hi> to <hi>one another,</hi> and therefore his Human Part was in a manner equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> he was by <hi>nature all things to all men, that he might gain the more.</hi> And being ſo nearly allied by the bands of Nature, both to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and to the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, it can be the leſs ſuſpected that he had any deſign, but what did equally concern the happineſs of them both.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98888:61"/>
            <p>And now I am the leſs diſpleaſed with this conceit in that ſince I find <hi>Grotius,</hi> a man of unqueſtionable judgment, as well as Learning, to concur with me in the ſame opinion. His words are theſe upon <hi>Ruth 1. 4.

            <p>But when all is done, it neither is nor ought to be looked upon as any ſuch diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that in our <hi>Saviours</hi> Genealogy there are inceſtuous Mixtures to be found.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98888:61"/> it would be found at the bottom of the greateſt names, if any records took notice of ſuch obſcure matters, not only that there was,</p>
            <q>Aut paſtor—aut illud quod dicere nolo.</q>
            <p>But that even Baſtardy and Inceſt would appear, and the beſt of us all would be found to owe our Being to thoſe Crimes, which are branded with the moſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious names, and which as we cenſure the moſt heavily in others, ſo in our ſelves we cannot think of them without a ſenſe of Abhorrency and Shame; And yet for all that I hope every gallant man is and ought to be meaſured by himſelf, a mans own Vertues or Vices are the only things in which he is properly concerned; it is rather a Diſparagement than Commendation to a bad man, that he is deſcended of a Vertuous and truly Honourable Stock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he adds degeneracy to folly; and it is on the contrary an additional commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Vertuous Offspring of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſorderly Parents, that he will not ſuffer the diſeaſes of his Family to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, but gives a nobler example to Poſterity, than he received of them which went before him. And at the worſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt is not an Offence againſt the Primary, but only againſt the Secondary Laws of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98888:62"/> Nature, that is, it is not properly a ſin in a man conſidered by himſelf, which is the caſe of all bodily Intemperance, and of all exorbitant Paſſion in the Mind, but it is a relative or conſequential offence as he is a member of a Society, and as thoſe Matches which are called inceſtuous, are prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the intereſt and well being of that Society in which he has Enrolled and Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, of which I ſhall ſpeak more largely in that other diſcourſe to which this is preparatory and introductive.</p>
            <p>Having thus given an account of the great Antiquity of this Cuſtom of the Brothers Marrying the Childleſs Brothers Wife, and in what caſe it was uſually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed withal in the earlieſt times, I will now give an account of the reaſons of it likewiſe, which is more than any man hath done before me. The reaſon then is this, that the <hi>Patres familiarum</hi> or Maſters of Families, in the beginnings of things, had, as hath been ſhewn, a Deſpotical and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power over their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, every Family being a <hi>little Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> by its ſelf, in which there lay no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the Maſter of the houſe, but his will was the laſt and only meaſure by which all things were to be adminiſtr'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98888:62"/> and govern'd; and this appears not only from what hath been ſaid already, in the caſe of <hi>Judah</hi> condemning <hi>Thamar,</hi> and compelling <hi>Onan</hi> to an ungrateful Office, but much more evidently from the ſtory of the Battle of four Kings againſt five, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. all which Kings were little better, if indeed any thing more, than <note n="*" place="margin">Not much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than theſe were the Thirty One Kings conquered by <hi>Joſhua</hi> on the Weſt ſide of <hi>Jordau,</hi> whoſe names are ſet down <hi>Joſh.</hi> 12.</note> Maſters of great Families, or of a very few families joyned together under one common head, however it is certain that <hi>Abraham</hi> who was as abſolute a Prince as the beſt of them, and as it appears by the ſtory much more potent, was certainly no more than the Maſter of a ſingle Family, and yet was more than an equal match for the four Kings, and is called a Confederate of the five, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and <hi>v.</hi> 14. is ſaid to have <hi>armed his trained Servants born in his own houſe</hi> (the Seventy render it <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Servant maid given together with her Miſtriſs, was in the Nature of a dowry, and was as much in the diſpoſal of the Supreme Lord the Maſter of the Houſe, whether to give away or ſell, or what he pleaſed, as any other dead or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ſubſtance whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Neither was this all but the Husband was an abſolute Lord over his Wife, and the Wife was in the Nature of a Servant to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. This is the reaſon why <hi>Sarah</hi> ſtiles her Husband by the name of Lord. And that not out of flattery or complaiſance but privately to her ſelf, imagining that no Body heard her, which ſhews it to have been the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thoſe times, <hi>Gen. 18. 12.

            </p>
            <p>But if they had ſuch power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over their Wives, it is much more to be ſuppoſed that they were likewiſe inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame abſolute, and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dominion over their Children, ſo as to puniſh them, if the fact ſhould to them ſeem to require it with Death its ſelf, as has already been made probable, by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, which ſeems to have taken its Patern from elder times, and from the example of <hi>Thamar,</hi> who was by <hi>Judah</hi> being his Sons Wife conſidered as his Daughter; all which is yet farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the expreſs teſtimony of the Law its ſelf, by which a rebellious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Son, was upon the complaint of the Parents, if there remained no hopes of amendment, without farther proceſs to be ſtoned to Death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20, 21. which was no doubt a remainder of that abſolute right and power, which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had over their Children before the Law, and which was ſo far from being perfectly taken away by it, that they ſeem rather to have been under an obligation to accuſe them, in caſes of obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98888:64"/> diſobedience, as the City or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation among whom the fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were under another to Stone them till they died, <hi>v. 20, 21.

            <p>Much more then, might they diſinherit them, and give the Birth-right from the Eldeſt to another, and ſo downwards as low as they pleaſed, either for a ſmall crime or for none at all, if it ſhould ſo ſeem good, which it is certain they actually did: for to <hi>Jacob</hi> were born by his Wife <hi>Leah</hi> four Sons one after another, without any other between them, <hi>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Gen. 29. 32, 33, 34, 35.

            <p>But it is moſt likely that <hi>Jacob</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Judah</hi> alſo, as being concerned in the common hatred of all the Brothers to their Brother <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 37. 4, 5. and was the adviſer of his ſelling into <hi>Egypt, v.</hi> 27. which being a temperament both of mercy and cruelty together, for the others would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him outright. It was from hence perhaps, that the <hi>Jews</hi> have concluded that <hi>Jacob</hi> did not diſpoſſeſs him of his whole Birth-right, but gave only to <hi>Joſeph</hi> a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion of the Inheritance, leaving all other things in their natural and uſual
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98888:66"/> ſtate, for to the Elder Brother the <hi>Maſters</hi> tell us there belonged three things. Firſt he was the <hi>King</hi> of the Family to reign in his Fathers ſtead after his deceaſe. Secondly he was the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of it, and Thirdly he was to enjoy a <hi>double ſhare</hi> of the Inheritance, which double ſhare they affirm to have been given to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and that his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right which is ſaid to have been given him conſiſted only in that.</p>
            <p>And truly to give them their due, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Nature is very reaſonable to believe, for its manifeſt not only from the place of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> above cited that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah prevailed over his Brethren,</hi> but he did this as the Rightful Heir, by vertue of his Fathers bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 8, 9, 10. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>thou art he whom thy Brethren ſhall praiſe; thy Hand ſhall be in the Neck of thine Enemies, thy Fathers Children ſhall bow down before thee.</hi> Judah <hi>is a Lyons Whelp, from the prey, my Son, thou art gone up: he ſtooped down, he couched as a Lyon, and as an Old Lyon, who ſhall rouſe him up? The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come, and unto him ſhall the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the People be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is clear therefore that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> or Soveraignty over his Brethren, was beſtowed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98888:66"/> upon <hi>Judah,</hi> and as for the <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> it was after appropriated upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> not by the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but of God himſelf. It is likely therefore that as <hi>Judah</hi> tempered mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with his hatred, and was in the midſt of his Envy an Inſtrument of ſaving his Brother <hi>Joſephs</hi> Life, ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> mixed the <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> with the <hi>Severity</hi> of a <hi>Judge,</hi> and depriving him only of a part of what belonged to him as his Birth-right, as a puniſhment for his offence, left him the reſt entire, as being due to him as the Eldeſt, and as the reward of his mercy.</p>
            <p>But yet after all this, he paſſed by not only <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Naphtali,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Rachel</hi> by her Handmaid <hi>Bilhah,</hi> as alſo <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Aſher</hi> the Sons of <hi>Leah,</hi> by her handmaid <hi>Zilphah</hi> but likewiſe <hi>Iſſachar</hi> and <hi>Zebulon</hi> the Sons of <hi>Leah</hi> her ſelf, all of them Elder than <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and all diſpoſſeſſed of the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right without any reaſon at all but only the Arbitrary power with which their Father was inveſted, unleſs it were perhaps upon ſome <hi>Prophetick</hi> reaſons, which neither are or can be at this time known to us, as it was in the caſe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh, Gen. 48. 17, 18, 19.

            <p>Now one great inſtance of that Subjection and Duty, which was paid by the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Elder in thoſe times was this, that in caſe the latter died without Iſſue, his Widow might challenge the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as her own and late Husband's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to perform the part and office of an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98888:69"/> Husband in his ſtead. And that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing elſe but an acknowledgment of Servitude and Subjection, will appear not only from the reluctancy of <hi>Onan,</hi> of which I have already ſpoken, but from the Stories of <hi>Sarah, Leah,</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> all of them Inſtances of the ſame nature, who finding themſelves barren, appointed their reſpective Handmaids <hi>Hagar, Zilpah,</hi> and <hi>Bilhah,</hi> to conceive by their Husbands in their ſtead, all which Children ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, were accounted in the eſteem of thoſe times Legitimate, and looked upon as inheriting not in right of the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, who were their real and proper, but of their <hi>Miſtreſſes</hi> the <hi>adoptive</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> Mothers, whoſe Children in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Law they were accounted. <hi>Gen. 16. 2.

            </p>
            <p>Nay, ſo great a propriety did they conceive themſelves to have in the Children of their Handmaids, that if they had been never ſo truly and properly their own they could not expreſs a greater joy and ſatisfaction at it,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98888:69"/> and it was they, not their real Mothers, who gave them their names. <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 6.

            </p>
            <p>Neither was <hi>Leah</hi> leſs fond of her Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Children by her Handmaid <hi>Zilpah</hi> v. 11. <hi>And</hi> Leah <hi>ſaid a Troop cometh</hi> (70 <gap reason="foreign">

It would therefore be better to keep exactly to the Senſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>And it ſhall be when they have brought forth.</hi> But though this be right as to the ſenſe, yet it is not <hi>Verbum verbo;</hi> which, though a fault in ſome tranſlations, is a Virtue in this.

It muſt therefore of neceſſity be that when it is ſaid, when the women ſhall be upon the <hi>haabnaim,</hi> that by that word, ſome Inſtrument or Utenſil, made uſe of in the Midwifery of thoſe times muſt be underſtood, and indeed it is not likely to have been any thing elſe but a <hi>Stool</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, where the Woman in Labour was placed by the Midwife, which anſwers moſt naturally to the ſignification of the Prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>hal (upon)</hi> which is added to a word of

But we might judge with more certainty of the goodneſs of this punctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if the <hi>Hexapla</hi> or <hi>Octapla</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> which are unhappily loſt, could be retreived. The Seventy by tranſlating it by <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Where you ſee likewiſe that there is no mention made at all of the two Hand-maids <hi>Bilhah</hi> and <hi>Zilpah.</hi> Notwithſtanding they were the natural and proper mothers, of <hi>Dan, Naphtali, Gad</hi> and <hi>Aſher,</hi> but the whole buſineſs of building up the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is aſcribed perfectly to <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> the reaſon is becauſe the others did but ſupply their places and conceive in their ſtead, and becauſe in ſuch caſes they were uſed to bring forth upon the <hi>Knees</hi> of their Miſtreſſes, which did in this caſe ſupply the Office of thoſe <hi>Maieutical Stools</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 16, ſo as the real Mother ſitting upon the Lap of the Adoptive, they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98888:71"/> were like two Perſons united into one, and whatſoever the one did or ſuffered at that time, became by this means to be aſcribed to the other.</p>
            <p>Now nothing is more certain than that the reaſon of this laſt Cuſtom was founded in the ſervitude and entire ſubjection of the Handmaid to her Miſtreſs. And it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved that the reſpect or relation which a younger Brother by the cuſtom and uſage of thoſe times bore to the Elder was the ſame, it is clear therefore the actions being in both Inſtances of the ſame Nature, and the Perſons of the ſame quality, that what was done on both ſides, was for the ſame reaſon, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſcovered the Antiquity of this uſage, and the reaſon of it, and given an Inſtance of a Caſe in which it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have been diſpenſed with. I will now take Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and the <hi>Rabbins</hi> whom he follows, to task, not ſo much out of a vainglorious humour, to triumph over the miſtakes or miſapprehenſions of ſo Learned and ſo deſervedly Famous a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as out of love to Truth, which we ſhould all prefer above the greateſt names, and indeed let a mans Wit, or Judgment,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98888:72"/> or Induſtry, be what it will, if he be but guilty of that one miſtake of giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the Conduct of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that it ſelf will involve him in a Thouſand more, for when all is done, when all their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates have ſaid their beſt for them, they are but good Gueſſers no more than we, when they appear at the greateſt advantage; but for the moſt part they do but father their own miſtakes and blunders upon Antiquity, and diſcover almoſt an equal degree of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Ignorance together.</p>
            <p>The firſt miſtake which I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in this affair is this: It is ſaid <hi>Deut. 25. 6. And it ſhall be that the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born which ſhe beareth, ſhall ſucceed in the name of his Brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of</hi> Iſrael. Where Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> moved only by the Authority of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> will needs have it, that by the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> not he that is <hi>firſt begotten and brought forth</hi> in this <hi>Leviratical</hi> Wedlock, but the <hi>Levir</hi> himſelf, or the <hi>next</hi> Brother to the deceaſed is to be underſtood, and that by thoſe words, <hi>which ſhe beareth,</hi> not the <hi>Wife</hi> but the <hi>Mother</hi> of the deceaſed is meant, which is ſo wretched a Violence done to the moſt natural and eaſie ſenſe of the words, which is this, that the firſt-born in this <hi>Vicarious</hi> Wedlock ſhall ſucceed in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98888:72"/> name, that is, the Inheritance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, that I wonder very much how he could ever perſuade himſelf to think this Opinion had ſo much as a bare poſſibility of truth, unleſs he thought the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conſtruction of the Sentence as it lies now in the Bible, was of leſs Authority than this diſtorted expoſition of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, the ſecond Brother, though he be the Eldeſt Survivor upon the death of the firſt, yet he can never be the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> it will be ever true, whether his Elder Brother be alive or dead, that there was one born before him, and it will not only be improper, but always falſe to call him the Firſt-born, unleſs it be in an <hi>Elliptical</hi> way, meaning the Firſt-born of thoſe that are alive; but what an obſcure unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible way of expreſſion is this? Or how would it be poſſible for men to underſtand one another, if they ſhould always talk at this rate? If this way of interpretation be once admitted, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> may go to School to the <hi>Rabbins</hi> to learn how to aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and may defend the Doctrine of <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reſervation,</hi> as being the very Stile and Language of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>And it ſhall be the Firſt-born which ſhe beareth.</hi> How can that be underſtood
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98888:73"/> of the <hi>Mother</hi> of the deceaſed, of whom there is no mention before?

            <p>This is the firſt miſtake. The ſecond is this:</p>
            <p>He plainly favours that conceit of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and ſome later <hi>Jews,</hi> who interpret that place. <hi>And it ſhall be that the Firſt-born which ſhe beareth, ſhall ſucceed in the name of the Brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Iſrael.</hi> As if the adoptive Child, were to be of the ſame name with his <hi>Imputative,</hi> that is to ſay the <hi>deceaſed Brother</hi> of his <hi>real</hi> Father. So as if his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98888:73"/> name were <hi>Joſe,</hi> the Childs muſt alſo be <hi>Joſe,</hi> and if <hi>John</hi> the Child's was to have been called <hi>John.</hi> But what if it proved a Girle? What then? Muſt it ſtill be <hi>Joſe</hi> or <hi>John?</hi> What can be more ridiculous than this? Beſides, why ſhould the <hi>Adoptive</hi> Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring bear the ſame name, when yet it was ſcarce ever known that the <hi>Real</hi> one ever did? Examine the whole Bible and you will ſcarce find one Inſtance where Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son were of the ſame name; And if his name muſt periſh out of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Son to inherit it, then for ought I can perceive it would at this rate be more eligible to have an <hi>Adoptive</hi> than a <hi>Real</hi> Son, becauſe the one by Cuſtom did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their names to Poſterity which the other did not. The Adoptive Son was intended to ſupply the place and to be in ſtead of a real one, and ſince the real one did very rarely, if ever go by the ſame name with his Father, what can be more unreaſonable than to believe the adoptive ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do it. Neither is this only contrary to reaſon but to experience too, for the eldeſt Son of <hi>Ruth</hi> by <hi>Boaz</hi> in the ſtead of <hi>Mahlon,</hi> was not called <hi>Mahlon</hi> but <hi>Obed,</hi> as hath been obſerved already.</p>
            <p>But here it is pretended that the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> is a perfectly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98888:74"/> thing, from that of the Brother to the Brother's Wife, and depends upon another Conſtitution of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, of the truth of which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> was ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">De ſucceſſ. in bon. defunct. c. 15.</note> perſuaded, that he has employed an whole Chapter in defence of it; with what ſucceſs we are now going to ſee.</p>
            <p>The Law upon which the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> depended is affirmed to be <hi>Levit. 25. 25, &amp;c.</hi> in theſe words. <hi>If thy Brother be waxen poor, and hath ſold away ſome of his poſſeſſion, and if any of his Kin come to redeem it, then ſhall he redeem that which his Brother ſold, and if the man have none to redeem it, then let him count the years of the ſale thereof, and reſtore the overplus unto the man unto whom he ſold it; that he may return unto his poſſeſſion, but if he be not able to reſtore it to him, then ſhall that which he ſold remain in the hand of him that bought it, until the year of</hi> Jubilee: <hi>And in the</hi> Jubilee <hi>it ſhall go out, and he ſhall return unto his poſſeſſion.</hi> This was the Law of Redemptions among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in caſe of a Morgage upon their own, their Brethren or their Kinſman's Land; and the reaſon why this is applied to the Caſe of <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> is becauſe of the frequent occurring of the word <hi>redeeming</hi> in that Story. <hi>v.</hi> 4. of that Chapter. <hi>If thou wilt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98888:74"/> redeem it, redeem it; but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: For there is none to redeem it beſides thee, and I am after thee. And he ſaid I will redeem it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus recited the words as they lie in the place of <hi>Leviticus</hi> above cited, which words are pretended to be the only ground of the Marriage betwixt <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Boaz.</hi> I will now impartially ſtate the caſe, and ſhew plainly how far this Law was concerned in this Marriage and how far it was not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruth 1. v.</hi> 1, 2. we have theſe words; <hi>Now it came to paſs in the days when the Judges ruled, that there was a famine in the Land, and a certain man of</hi> Bethlehem Judah, <hi>went to ſojourn in the Countrey of</hi> Moab, <hi>he and his Wife and his two Sons, and the name of the Man was</hi> Elimelech, <hi>and the name of his Wife</hi> Naomi, <hi>and the name of the two Sons</hi> Mahlon <hi>and</hi> Chilion, Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites <hi>of</hi> Bethlehem Judah: <hi>And they came into the Countrey of</hi> Moab <hi>and continued there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An expenſive continuance it was to be ſure, when they were forced to live whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Perſonal Eſtate, what Mony they had or could get together, while the real one lay waſt and would not yield any
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98888:75"/> thing at all. Beſides that, there being ſo heavy a Famine in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> it is not to be ſuppoſed, but that the ſame cauſes which had wrought this ſcarcity in <hi>Judaea</hi> did more or leſs prevail in <hi>Moab</hi> alſo, as being a bordering Countrey, as when the Seven years Famine was in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no leſs in the neighbouring Countreys at the ſame time; Proviſions muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be very dear, and they as being Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, were probably more hardly uſed than the Natives, and beſides were continually ſubject to the Violence and Injuſtice of a Nation who had ſufficient reaſon to be no friends to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How long this famine laſted we cannot tell, but the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> famine is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſuch Judgments in thoſe Countreys, were ſometimes of a very long continuance, and if you ſuppoſe it to have fallen upon the year before the <hi>Sabbatical</hi> as it might well enough do, when the whole Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was at reſt from all manner of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and Tillage, it muſt be of three years continuance at leaſt, that is to ſay, that year on which it began, the <hi>Sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> year wherein the Land reſted from Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and the year following till the time of Harveſt, for it is impoſſible both to ſow and reap-together.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98888:75"/>
            <p>Well, in proceſs of time <hi>Elimelech</hi> he dyes, and at his death divides his eſtate into three parts, one part of it he gives to <hi>Naomi,</hi> not wholly, for that it does not ſeem to have been in his power to do, by the Law of Inheritances, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. but only till the <hi>year of Jubilee,</hi> or perhaps by way of <hi>Jointure</hi> during her life; the reſt he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, after what manner is not ſaid, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we tell which was the eldeſt (for one is named firſt, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 5. the other, <hi>Ruth 4th,</hi> and the <hi>9th.</hi>) between <hi>Mahlon</hi> and <hi>Chilion,</hi> his two ſons, who, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine being not yet ended, the better to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure what they had, or perhaps to acquire more for their ſupport married each of them to a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Woman, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 4. but did not cohabit long with them, before they dyed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as their Father <hi>Elimelech</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. By which means it came to paſs, that the whole eſtate, which ſeems to have been paſſed over and conſigned to <hi>Naomi,</hi> in caſe the two Brothers dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, was now actually in her poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this is the meaning of that appeal of <hi>Boaz</hi> to the Elders. <hi>Ruth 4. 9. And</hi> Boaz <hi>ſaid unto the Elders and to all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ye are Witneſſes this day, that I have bought all that was</hi> Elimelech's, i. e. <hi>Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi>'s proper ſhare, <hi>and all that was</hi> Chilion's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98888:76"/> 
               <hi>and</hi> Mahlon'<hi>s of the hand of</hi> Naomi. From whence it will be eaſie to diſcern how far the Law in <hi>Leviticus</hi> concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the poor Brother's Inheritance was concerned. <hi>Elimelech</hi>'s eſtate upon the deceaſe of himſelf and his two Sons was now wholly in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Naomi,</hi> either till the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> or for the term of her natural life, for the reaſons already mentioned; this the next of Kin, to whom the Inheritance after the expiration of this term would of it ſelf devolve, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem at his pleaſure to re-unite it to the Inheritance of his Family, and that either by allowing ſo much as a valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Intereſt of her life in it, or by ſetting an equal value upon her Right in the time to come from the date of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> be it more or leſs, according to the manner preſcribed in that Chapter of <hi>Leviticus;</hi> if he would not redeem it then the next of Kin might do the ſame, yet ſo as he was only to enjoy it till the ſaid year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and then it muſt of courſe fall to the ſhare of the firſt refuſer, as being neareſt of Kin, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Platform of Succeſſions.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Boaz</hi> his caſe, who could not redeem the Inheritance of <hi>Elimelech,</hi> till
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98888:76"/> he that was neareſt of Kin had firſt refuſed, <hi>Ruth. 3. 12, 13. Now it is true that I am thy near Kinſman, howbeit there is a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nearer than I, tarry this night and it ſhall be in the Morning, that if he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto thee the part of a Kinſman, well, let him do the Kinſmans part, but if he will not do the part of a Kinſman to thee, then I will do the part of a Kinſman to thee, as the Lord liveth.</hi> Again <hi>Chap. 4. v. 3, 4. And he ſaid unto the Kinſman</hi> Naomi <hi>that is come again out of the Countrey of</hi> Moab, <hi>ſelleth a parcel of Land, which was our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Elimelech's, <hi>and I thought to advertiſe thee, ſaying, buy it before the Inhabitants, and before the Elders of my People, if thou wilt redeem it, redeem it, but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me that I may know: For there is none to redeem it beſides thee</hi> (that is, you are by Law to have the firſt refuſal) <hi>and I am after thee,</hi> as much as to ſay, and the next refuſal is mine.</p>
            <p>But now whereas I ſaid that the Eſtate of <hi>Elimelech</hi> was bequeathed to <hi>Naomi</hi> till the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> or during her Life, the latter of theſe ſeems to me the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable of the two, in that it is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Widow ſhould be always conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out of the fortune of the deceaſed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98888:77"/> for the tearm of her own Natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Life, which in many caſes would in all rational probability extend farther than the <hi>next</hi> year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and was to be ſure the moſt certain way to make a proviſion for her, neither could this be look'd upon as any Alienation, when the Eſtate after her deceaſe was to return into its proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; beſides, that <hi>Naomi</hi> for ought we know might be an Heireſs, which was the caſe of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad, Numb.</hi> 27. and 36. and of the Daughters of <hi>Sheſhan 1 Chron.</hi> 2. 34. of <hi>Eleazar, 1 Chron.</hi> 23. 22. and as I ſhall make it very probable in its due place, of <hi>Achſah</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Caleb, Joſh.</hi> 15. 16, 17. and <hi>Jud.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. in which caſe it would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable they ſhould be left deſtitute themſelves, who had brought an acceſſion of power and riches unto that part of their family unto which they were matched.</p>
            <p>Who they were that in caſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had a right of redemption, we find particularly ſet down in the Chapter of <hi>Leviticus</hi> ſo often mentioned, in the caſe of the poor Brother who had ſold himſelf to the ſtranger, for, I ſuppoſe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Inheritances is but one part of that Law in which the redemption of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98888:77"/> is included, and that the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming, is in both caſes inveſted in the ſame perſons; the words of the Law are theſe, <hi>Levit. 2. 47, 48, 49. If a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer or ſtranger wax rich by thee, and thy Brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and ſell himſelf unto the ſtranger or ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by thee, or to the ſtock of the ſtrangers family: After that he is ſold, he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed again; one of his Brethren may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him: Either his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle or his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son may redeem him, or any that is nigh of Kin unto him of his family, may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> It is certain that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators are of Opinion, that the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had a right of redemption, in the caſe of Inheritances as well as this, in that ſome of them, not by any tradition, but by the authority of this text, have determined <hi>Boaz</hi> to be Uncle to <hi>Mahlon</hi> the deceaſed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of <hi>Ruth,</hi> and others would have him be his <hi>Couſin German.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am rather for the latter of theſe, becauſe for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> to Marry the <hi>Niece</hi> which is the ſame thing with the <hi>Nephews Wife,</hi> is forbidden by parity of reaſon at leaſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 14. Neither is there any one inſtance to be found, after the delivery of the Law where it was ever diſpenſed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98888:78"/> with, but now there are inſtances in the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi> and of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> wherein the Marriage of <hi>Couſin Germans,</hi> (and a <hi>Couſin Germans Wife</hi> is the ſame thing) has been diſpenſed with; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much ſafer to conclude on that ſide, which has precedents to favour it, than on that which has none; beſides that the nearneſs of Kin being in a manner the ſame, between two Couſin Germans, and an Uncle Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with his Niece yet there is an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the former, which is one prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Marriage, which in the other there is not, but inſtead of that he is to his Neice, as hath been ſaid <hi>Parentis loco;</hi> which bar to Matrimony has always been ſo ſacred not only in the <hi>Moſaick</hi> but alſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, that it has never been broken down without the diſgrace and infamy of thoſe that gave the firſt example of ſo fowl a crime.</p>
            <p>But that which will put the matter out of all controverſie it this, that the reaſon of diſpenſations in Marriages of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being founded in that Servitude or Subjection, which the Younger ows to the Elder, it is manifeſt that a Couſin German, that is, the Son of a Younger Brother, might properly enough marry the relict of him who was the Son of the Elder; he does in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98888:78"/> this perform a ſervice to his Uncle, the Father of the deceaſed who was by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Law, a kind of Father to him, as well as the other, but the Uncle himſelf being to the Niece in the ſtead of a Parent, it being impoſſible that Superiority and Subjection can conſiſt together in the ſame perſon, with reſpect to the ſame, and ſo the reaſon of the diſpenſation ceaſing, the diſpenſation its ſelf muſt of Neceſſity ceaſe together with it. But yet after all I will not be too poſitive in this caſe, which ſeems to be ſomething extraordinary, if the Uncle would <hi>decedere de ſuo jure,</hi> if he would ſubmit himſelf to his deceaſed Nephew, whoſe perſon he did in this caſe ſuſtain, and equal himſelf in a manner to his Niece, to whom he is by Law and by Nature in the ſtead of a Parent, <hi>volenti non fit injuria.</hi> Therefore I leave this buſineſs as I found it, without determining any thing either way.</p>
            <p>But either way it is a very great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Jewiſh Writers</hi> whom he follows, to think that this match was not made in purſuance of that Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. by which the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was to raiſe up Seed to the deceaſed Brother, and to propagate his name and memory in his ſtead.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:98888:79"/>
            <p>The buſineſs in ſhort is thus, <hi>Naomi</hi> had paſſed over her Title to the Inheritance of <hi>Elimelech</hi> to her Daughter-in-Law <hi>Ruth,</hi> upon condition that he of the Kindred, who would accept of her Daughter for his Wife, ſhould have the Inheritance together with her; upon this <hi>Ruth</hi> challenges <hi>Boaz</hi> for her Husband, which challenge he did not refuſe, but only ſaid there was one near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kin than he, being as I conceive his Elder Brother, who was in this caſe always to have the firſt refuſal, and ſhe muſt firſt apply her ſelf unto him, it being not in his power to accept of what ſhe propoſed, till the other had refuſed to do it; it is therefore agreed that in the preſence of the Elders and the People, ſhe ſhall make her appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him: <hi>Naomi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Boaz,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Ruth, ſelleth a parcel of Land which was our Brother</hi> Elimelech's, you are the firſt perſon who by our Law have a right of redeeming it, ſay therefore whether you will redeem it or no: I will ſaid he, but did not think at the ſame time that he was to purchaſe a Wife into the bargain, wherefore being better informed of the true ſtate of things, he relinquiſhes his right to <hi>Boaz,</hi> who immediately takes <hi>Ruth</hi> to Wife in the preſence of the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to <hi>raiſe up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98888:79"/>
            <p>Now if he had a right of redeeming the Inheritance and yet not take the Woman for his Wife, then the former impediment would ſtill remain, there being no reaſon why he ſhould relinquiſh his right, either to <hi>Boaz</hi> or any other pretender; but if he had not, then it is manifeſt that the connexion of theſe two, the Land and the Woman to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as he muſt of neceſſity take both or neither, could not depend upon any other Law, than that of the Brother's raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Seed to the Brother.</p>
            <p>For it is another very groſs Error of theſe Writers, when they diſtinguiſh with ſo much nicety as they do, betwixt what they call the <hi>Jibboum</hi> and the <hi>Geulah,</hi> That is, the <hi>performing the Husbands part</hi> and the <hi>redemption of the Inheritance;</hi> for though they be two pretty names, and it may perhaps be a thouſand pitties that they do not ſignifie two pretty things, yet the miſchief of it is they are both of them the ſame, or if there be any difference it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the one is more comprehenſive than the other, ſo as in every <hi>Jibboum</hi> there is a <hi>Geulah,</hi> though in every <hi>Geulah,</hi> there be not a <hi>Jibboum,</hi> by the ſame rule in <hi>Logick,</hi> that every Pippin is an Apple, though every Apple be not a Pippin. For the deſign expreſſed in the Law why the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98888:80"/> Brother was to Marry the Brothers Wife, was to <hi>raiſe up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance,</hi> therefore where there was no <hi>Inheritance,</hi> neither was there any <hi>Jib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boum,</hi> and where there was an <hi>Inheritance</hi> there muſt be a <hi>Geulah.</hi> Theſe things are ſo very plain, that they need no confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they carry their own evidence in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But they tell us none had right to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Widdow of an Husband deceaſed without Iſſue, but the next Brother to the ſame Husband, and upon his refuſal the next to him, and ſo on; but this is only ſaid, not proved. It is true indeed that what the <hi>Rabbins</hi> call <hi>Jibboum</hi> or <hi>Leviratus,</hi> if you argue too nicely from the ſignification of a word which is of their own making, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed only in propriety of ſpeech to the Brother of the deceaſed; but as for all that is meant by it, and all that was the deſign of this Law, which was the performing of the Husbands part to the Widow of the deceaſed, this may be, and was Actually by the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther.</p>
            <p>For look you, the words of the Law are theſe, <hi>her Husbands Brother ſhall go in unto her.</hi> This the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> to appeal to themſelves, apply to the Eldeſt of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98888:80"/> Brethren if there were more of them, and it was very true that he was firſt to be applied to, but then if he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, application was to be made to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third, and ſo on. And that this was the order in which they were taken is evident from the ſtory of <hi>Er, Onan</hi> and <hi>Shelah</hi> already ſo much inſiſted upon, and from the Hiſtory of the ſeven Brethren all of them ſucceſſively Married to the ſame Woman, in the Goſpel; but what if all the immediate Brethren refuſed, as they might do if they pleaſed? ſhall the mans name periſh for want of an adoptive Heir rather than the next of Kin ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to, to perform the Husbands part?</p>
            <p>The 70 Interpreters who underſtood theſe matters better than either Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> or any of thoſe Authors, whom he is pleaſed to follow in this matter, were not of his mind; their words are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> thinks to compound the buſineſs thus, as he is cited by <hi>Selden de ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſionibus</hi> p. 106. <hi>Chiatta legaol Nacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath Iſhi:</hi> He makes <hi>Ruth</hi> ſpeak to <hi>Boaz</hi> in this manner, <hi>you are to redeem the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my Husband,</hi> &amp;c. And then, <hi>I and my Mother in Law are compelled to ſell our Inheritance; it is therefore incumbent upon you to buy it, as being next of Kin, and with the Inheritance you muſt take me too, that ſo the name of the deceaſed may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98888:82"/> becauſe of his Inheritance, ſo that when ever I come upon the Lands which he poſſeſſed, men may ſay this was the Wife of</hi> Mahlon. And ſo they might whether ſhe had Marryed any Body or no, after the deceaſe of her Husband, ſo that it is manifeſt this is but a meer ſhift, and cannot be the meaning of <hi>raiſing up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance;</hi> but it is ſtill for all this of the ſame meaning with that of <hi>Deut. that his name be not put out of</hi> Iſrael, and with a like expreſſion of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad Num. 27. v. 3, 4. Our Father dyed in the Wilderneſs, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themſelves together againſt the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>why ſhould the name of our Father be done away from among his family, becauſe he hath no Son; give unto us therefore a poſſeſſion among the Brethren of our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where it is plain that a <hi>name's</hi> being <hi>done way from a Family,</hi> and a mans not leaving a poſſeſſion to ſome Body to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit in his right, ſo as it was neceſſary the memory of his name ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the aſſerting of the Title, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame thing. For Women could not continue the memory of their Parents; in all the old Teſtament you ſcarce ever find them inſerted in the Genealogies, they have their name from <hi>oblivion,</hi> as men
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98888:82"/> have theirs from <hi>remembrance,</hi> becauſe they carry on and continue the Pedigree of their Fore-Fathers, but the Women are reckoned only as a part of their Husbands, and their Children as the Poſterity not of theirs, but of their Husbands Fathers, and are diſtinguiſhed from the Poſterity of their own; to which we have a manifeſt alluſion <hi>Pſalm 45. 16. Inſtead of thy Fathers thou ſhalt have Children, whom thou mayſt make Princes in all Lands.</hi> It was neceſſary therefore that to propagate the memory of the Father by the Daughters when he had no Male Iſſue, they ſhould be conſidered as <hi>Heireſſes,</hi> and the eſtate deſcending from them to their Poſterity in right of their Father; his name and memory was by this means continued, which otherwiſe would have periſhed as effectually as if he had had no Children at all. From all which it is plain, that for a mans name not to be <hi>put out of</hi> Iſrael, not to be <hi>done away from among his Family,</hi> and to <hi>riſe up upon his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> are all of them the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To put the matter yet farther out of queſtion, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 13. the redemption of the Inheritance, and the Marriage of the Woman to whom in right of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it belonged, as being intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with one another, are both of them

            <p>All which is mightily corroborated by the Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. L.</hi> 5.

               </gap>, that is, <hi>Boaz appealing to the Aſſembly of the Elders, bad them take notice of the refuſal of the neareſt Kinſman, and then inſtructed Ruth in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98888:83"/> of the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>to take off his Shoe and ſpit in his Face;</hi> which done he immediately Marryed her in the preſence of them all.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will not allow this to be any thing better than a miſtake of <hi>Joſephus, Confuſio,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>planiſſimè binarum legum, quarum altera de haereditate alienatâ, ſeu emptores invitante redimendà, altera de fratriâ ducendâ eſt.</hi> But I think I have made it pretty plain already that it is Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf is in the miſtake, not <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and I cannot but obſerve that it is that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentlemans misfortune to ſide with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> only in his Errors, as when he tells us the adoptive Child was to be of the ſame name with his imputative Father, but when he ſpeaks reaſon, as he does certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this caſe, to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Joſephus</hi> does not deliver this out of any Authentick record, as is apparent by this, that we have already found him in ſeveral miſtakes, but it is only his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or perhaps the ſenſe of the Learned men of his time, that this place was to be referr'd to the Law of the <hi>Leviratus,</hi> and ſo he added the deſcription of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>de ſuo,</hi> as being a part of that Law, and which he thought was never omitted, in caſe the perſon to whom the challenge
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98888:84"/> was made, refuſed to accept it, only this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is much to be wondred at, as a very great inconſiſtency in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that he ſhould acknowledge the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> to have been made in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and purſuance of that Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> by which the Brother was to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the name and memory of the Brother, and yet underſtand that expreſſion, that his <hi>name be not put out of</hi> Iſrael, as if the Child was to be of the ſame name, with his adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Father, when as it is clear that the Son of <hi>Ruth</hi> by <hi>Boaz</hi> was not called <hi>Mahlon</hi> but <hi>Obed,</hi> which name is from <hi>habad, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivit,</hi> and was given him, as I conceive, for this reaſon, to denote that he was a Servant to <hi>Mahlon,</hi> to continue his name upon his Inheritance, and propagate his memory by a new ſucceſſion of deſcendants from his Loyns, to after ages, which is ſtill a further confirmation of what I have endeavoured to prove.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſtill objected, that <hi>Ruth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Woman, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Boaz</hi> nor any other <hi>Jew</hi> could Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, it being ſo far from being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any Law, that it was expresſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of <hi>Moſes Deut. 7. 3. neither ſhalt thou make Marriages with them: thy Daughter thou ſhalt not give unto
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98888:84"/> his Son, nor his Daughter ſhalt thou take unto thy Son.</hi> But this, if it had been a good objection, might have been urged by him that was nearer of Kin to the Family of <hi>Elimelech</hi> than <hi>Boaz</hi> was, and ſince it was not, we have more reaſon to conclude, that ſhe was then proſelyted and naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and become as one of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which it is certain ſhe did paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſire, <hi>Ruth. 1. 16. And</hi> Ruth <hi>ſaid, intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee: for whither thou goeſt I will go, and where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God ſhall be my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this caſe there was no reaſon why he might not take her to his Wife, eſpecially if you conſider that ſuch Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages were allowed, after ſome Ceremonies there mentioned, in the caſe of a Captive, of whom yet it was not required that ſhe ſhould be ſo much as a Proſelyte to the Religion of the <hi>Jews, Deut. 21. v.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. the ſame was the caſe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Servant, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 34, 35. who yet not withſtanding was Married to an <hi>Heireſs,</hi> although it be the expreſs Law of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Inheritance ſhould be ſo far from going into the hand of a forreigner, that it was not to remove
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98888:85"/> ſo much as from Tribe to Tribe, nor if it could be avoided, out of one Family of the ſame Tribe into another, and though it were equally forbidden to Marry a <hi>Servant</hi> as a <hi>Stranger,</hi> ſo that here was a double incapacity, and yet this was it ſeems no hindrance to the Marriage; neither is the thing mentioned as irregular, or taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of with the leaſt degree of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: We may therefore very probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he was firſt manumitted or ſet free, then adopted, not by <hi>Sheſhan</hi> the Father of the Damſel, for this could not be, for no man can adopt a <hi>Nephew</hi> or <hi>Niece,</hi> but only a <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter,</hi> and this would be for <hi>Siſter</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> to match toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he was adopted by the Brother or Uncle of <hi>Sheſhan,</hi> and ſo Married to his Daughter in the Nature of one that was neareſt of Kin to her, as in the Inſtance of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi> and <hi>Eleazar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, That it was <hi>Joſephus</hi> his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate opinion, that the Marriage between <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> was in purſuance of the <hi>Leviratical</hi> or rather the <hi>anchiſteutical</hi> ſanction in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and that they were not words ſpoken <hi>aliud agendo</hi> and by chance, when he tells us of <hi>Ruths taking off her Kinſmans Shoe, and Spitting in his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98888:85"/> Face,</hi> will appear plainly from other words in the ſame <hi>paragraph,</hi> importing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating the ſame thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But what are theſe <hi>Laws</hi> which he ſpeaks of ſo often: are they not the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Leviratus</hi> or the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? ſearch all the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> from one end to the other, and you will find no other Law to which this can refer. It is manifeſt therefore that <hi>Joſephus</hi> has not only plainly, but with ſome ſeeming ſollicitude delivered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Marriage of <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> was in purſuance of that Law, and I think it is equally clear from all that has been ſaid, that he does not confound two Laws together as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has repreſented him to have done.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this, I will obſerve that <hi>Joſephus</hi> though he have made ſome unwarrantable additions of his own, of which I have carefully taken notice, yet that he took his relation out of that very Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> which is now received among us, and out of thoſe very <hi>Greek In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi> which are now in uſe, which I will ſhew plainly from two things. Firſt he tells you, though falſly, that he who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98888:86"/> was <hi>nearer of Kin</hi> than <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Elimelech,</hi> was in actual poſſeſſion of the Inheritance <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was the <hi>Law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> or that Law which permitted the next of Kin to Marry the Wife of the deceaſed and poſſeſs himſelf of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the bargain; for which reaſon <hi>Boaz,</hi> who is by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> called <hi>Goel,</hi> or the redeemer, is all along by the <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or the <hi>near Kinſman,</hi> and their tranſlation of <hi>c. 4. v.</hi> 6. is very remarkable; the words of the Hebrew are theſe, <hi>Vajomer Hagoel Lo oucal Ligeol li, phen Aſhchith eth Nachalathi, Geal atta eth Geulathi, chi lo oucal legeol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Greek</hi> theſe.</p>
            <q>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</q>
            <p>The Second thing by which this appears is this, that he who is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Elimelech,</hi> is by <hi>Joſephus</hi> all along called <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and this he had alſo out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, though not out of that reading of it which the <hi>Vatican</hi> preferrs; but the <hi>Alexandrine Mſ.</hi> will both ſhew you that it is a corruption and by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98888:86"/> what degrees it proceeded to be what it is, for <hi>Ch. 2. v.</hi> 4. that copy reads it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>All this may be yet farther ſtrengthened from the Law mentioned in the Book of <hi>Numbers c.</hi> 35. concerning <hi>Chance-Medly</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilling Slaughter,</hi> in which caſe if a man could firſt fly to One of the Six Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Refuge, and when his cauſe came to an hearing it appeared that there was no evil intention nor any malice fore-thought in him that had committed the fact, he was ſafe ſo long as he continued within the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moeria</hi> of the ſaid City, during the life of that High Prieſt in whoſe <hi>Pontificate</hi> the thing was done, and after that he might repair to his own home, and enjoy all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of an innocent and guiltleſs Perſon, but in caſe the <hi>Revenger of Blood</hi> ſhould overtake him before he could get to one of theſe Cities, or if after he had made his eſcape thither he ſhould afterwards at any time within the time prefixed, be found any where without the Bounds or <hi>Pomoeria</hi> of the ſaid City, then it was lawful for the <hi>Revenger of Blood</hi> to exact one life for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and avenge the Death of the Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Party, with that of him who did tho' never ſo unwillingly ſlay him. Now who was this <hi>Revenger of Blood? Joſephus</hi> tells
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98888:87"/> you it was any of the Kindred. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 8. his words are theſe. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That is, Moſes <hi>built Ten Cities, being parcel of the Fourty eight aſſigned to the Levites, of which Three were Sanctuarys, for ſuch as unwillingly had ſlain a Man. The time of their conſinement to any of the ſaid places was during the life of that High Prieſt, in whoſe time ſuch an accident fell out. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe, he was at liberty to return home, or go whither he pleaſed in ſafety. But in the mean time, if he were taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bounds of the ſaid Sanctuary to which he was conſin'd, it was lawful for any of the Kindred, and none elſe, to kill him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you ask what Authority <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> has for this, the Anſwer will be that he took this as he does every thing elſe from the Seventy <hi>Interpreters.</hi> For that which we call in our Tranſlation the <hi>Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Blood,</hi> is in the <hi>Hebrew Goel Hadam.</hi> And in the Seventy all along in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Deuteronomie,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> it is

Neither does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear only from the Identity or Sameneſs of the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in all theſe caſes, and from the agreement of the Seventy in their Verſion in every one of the caſes now inſiſted upon, that the word <hi>Goel</hi> which we render the <hi>Revenger,</hi> is to be underſtood in this laſt inſtance as well as in the other, of ſomebody that was nigh of Kin, but it is no leſs evident from the expreſs words of the <hi>Original Text</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Deut. 19. 5, 6. He ſhall fly unto One of thoſe Cities and live, leſt the Avenger of Blood purſue the Slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, becauſe the way is long, and ſlay him, whereas he was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, inſomuch as he hated him not in time paſt.</hi> Now in the firſt place it is a very wild piece of extravagance to ſuppoſe, that a man having killed another by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect chance, ſhould for this reaſon lie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fury of every man who had the power or opportunity to revenge it, without any proceſs or formality of Law,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98888:88"/> that it might be ſeen firſt whether he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch puniſhment or no. In the ſecond place there was no reaſon why every mans <hi>heart</hi> ſhould be <hi>hot,</hi> or ſwell'd with a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous appetite of revenge, as faſt as any other, whom perhaps they never knew or heard of before, ſhould come to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, it ſeems therefore moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to confine it only to the relations or friends of the party deceaſed, who may well enough be ſuppoſed, eſpecially thoſe that are ſo very near, to have had the greateſt friendſhip for him, and the deepeſt ſhare in that loſs which is ſuſtained by his death. Thirdly, We muſt not Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Law did countenance reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Nature, but it did only pardon the infirmity of men, whoſe <hi>heart was hot,</hi> i. e. overpowered with an exceſs of grief and a maſterleſs deſire of revenge, which paſſionate concern may well enough be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to enter into the breaſt of a <hi>Brother, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> that is <hi>near of Kin,</hi> eſpecially if to the nearneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity, a ſtrict friendſhip and a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dependance be joyned, but cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be pretended by any in his excuſe, whoſe circumſtances of Birth and Fortune are at a farther diſtance from the perſon ſlain.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:98888:89"/>
            <p>The uſe which I make of theſe things is this, that all theſe three inſtances do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually confirm and ſtrengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the right of redeeming the perſon of the poor Brother, has been ſhewn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the near Kinſman by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the Law its ſelf, that is to ſay, to the <hi>Brother,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> that is <hi>near of Kin,</hi> that is, at the leaſt a degree farther than this; the ſame is likewiſe agreed by all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, of the <hi>redemption of Inheritances,</hi> and is in it ſelf very reaſonable to believe, it being mentioned in the very ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the other, without any particular mention, who are the perſons in whom the Right of Redemption is legally inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the perſons who are ſpecified in this latter caſe, be underſtood <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If then whoever redeemed the perſon of a Brother that had ſold himſelf, might alſo avenge his blood, in caſe he were ſlain by chance, and might redeem his Inheritance when through poverty or want it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred or alienated from him; and if the reaſon of that Vicarious Wedlock which is uſually, but falſely confined to the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the deceaſed, was for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inheritance, and to hinder it from going to any other Tribe, or as nigh as might be into another Houſe, then it follows plainly, that whoever might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Inheritance might Lawfully Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Wife of the deceaſed, which had no other end but this; which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>And now if it be asked why in the Law of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the <hi>Jabem</hi> or <hi>deceaſed Husbands Brother</hi> is only mentioned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo many of the Kindred might Marry to the Widow, I anſwer it was for theſe three reaſons, Firſt, Becauſe the firſt refuſal of the Widow and of the Inheritance was his. Secondly, Becauſe he was under the ſtricteſt obligation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98888:90"/> the name and memory of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Brother in the nature of his Servant, whereas though the other relations might if they pleaſed, do it upon the refuſal of the Brethren, yet not ſtanding in the ſame relation of ſervants to the deceaſed, they were not as I conceive under the ſame obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Laſtly, <hi>Denominatio ſumitur a parte potiori,</hi> becauſe it did actually ſo come to paſs for the moſt part, that one of the ſurviving Brethren did accept of the Challenge made by the Woman in behalf of her deceaſed Husband, and there was good reaſon why he ſhould, if he were not Married before, becauſe by this means there was, as I have ſaid, one Child provided for, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plentifully, for there was a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the caſe, which belonged of right to the Elder Brother, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. and it is not improbable that he received like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe into the bargain this farther advantage, that during his own life he had the entire management and diſpoſal of this eſtate, for the ſupport of himſelf, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all his Family, though at his death he muſt leave it as he found it, and could not cut off the Entail from the Eldeſt Son of this imputative or adoptive Bed.</p>
            <p>This might, for ought we know, be the reaſon why the Marriage of the Brother
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98888:90"/> to the Brothers Wife, was ſo ſeverely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by ſeveral <hi>Imperial</hi> Laws, both in the <hi>Corpus Juris Civilis</hi> of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and in the <hi>Theodoſian Code,</hi> which practice might perhaps creep, though not for the ſame reaſon of raiſing up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance, out of <hi>Judea</hi> into the Empire, but if any man had rather think that this was an effect only of that <hi>Libertiniſme,</hi> and <hi>Licentiouſneſs,</hi> to which men are but too ſubject of themſelves, I am ſo far from contending, that perhaps I ſhall be more inclinable to be of his opinion; but it is certain that this practice, ſo far as it was uſed among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> was borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> or perhaps from thoſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times from whom the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves received it, which may be plainly proved from the words of that <hi>Imperial Reſcript</hi> by which it was at length forbidden by the Emperor <hi>Zeno;</hi> they are theſe:</p>
            <q>IMP. ZENO. A. EPINICO. P. P.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Now that this cuſtom among the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> was received from the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from theſe words, <hi>quod certis legum conditoribus placuit,</hi> which <hi>legum conditores</hi> are <hi>Moſes</hi> and thoſe other <hi>Lawgivers</hi> of <hi>Earlier times,</hi> from whom he himſelf received it; and though it be true that the <hi>Jews</hi> Married the Wife of their deceaſed Brother, whether ſhe were a <hi>Virgin</hi> or no, in caſe ſhe had no <hi>Male Iſſue,</hi> yet it is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as true, that there were thoſe that would not allow this Law to take place, but only in ſuch, as had never been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the deceaſed Husband; of which number there is no meaner a man than <hi>R. Shammai</hi> himſelf, the head of one of the two famous <hi>Phariſaick</hi> Schools, as <hi>R. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel</hi> was of the other, and the <hi>Samaritanes ad unum omnes;</hi> but I take this only upon the Authority of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 5. hath theſe words, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor defuncti,) malè Sammai &amp; Samaritani hoc de deſponſatâ tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98888:91"/> interpretantur, obſtant tum alia, tum Gen.</hi> 38. 6. and if this was the Opinion of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> who yet certainly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their knowledge of this Law from the <hi>Jews,</hi> why might it not be of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> too?</p>
            <p>Again, if theſe matches were made by others up and down the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as the <hi>ſame Edict</hi> does more than ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, <hi>ad exemplum Aegyptiorum,</hi> then it is true what I have already hinted, though I would not be very confident of it, that the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves received it from the <hi>Jews</hi> Originally, for <hi>cauſa cauſoe eſt cauſa cauſati.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus proved that by the <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> is meant not the <hi>Levir</hi> himſelf but the <hi>Eldeſt</hi> Son of the <hi>Leviratical Bed,</hi> and that by <hi>raiſing up the name of the dead,</hi> by <hi>hindring his name from being blotted out of</hi> Iſrael, is not meant that the adoptive birth was to be of the <hi>ſame name</hi> with the deceaſed Father, having ſhewn that the Marriage of <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> was in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and purſuance of that Law in <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi> whereby the Brother was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and obliged to <hi>raiſe up Seed to his deceaſed Brother:</hi> Laſtly, Having demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that by the <hi>Name,</hi> the <hi>Inheritance</hi> is meant, and given the reaſon why it is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98888:92"/> ſo, becauſe it was neceſſary the name of the dead ſhould be continued for the aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Title; by the light of what has been ſaid we may now diſcover two other Errors of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and his <hi>Rabbins;</hi> his words are theſe, p. 99, 100. <hi>Conſenſu Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrorum, poſteri à fratre fratriam ducente ſuſcepti omnes, pro vario jure in aliis ſpecie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſucceſſionis, defuncti fratris haereditatem capiebant.</hi> In which words there are no leſs than two very groſs miſtakes. The Firſt is this, that this opinion ſuppoſeth all the Children begotten by the <hi>Levir</hi> or <hi>near Kinſman</hi> upon his Brothers Wife were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and looked upon as the Children of the party deceaſed; and the Second which is expresſly aſſerted, that they had all of them a ſhare in the Inheritance, both of which muſt needs be falſe, if by <hi>ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the name of the dead, Deut.</hi> 25. 6. nothing elſe can be meant, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that nothing elſe is or can be, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, he was to <hi>Inherit</hi> the Eſtate and Patrimony of the deceaſed, for this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd only to the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> by the expreſs words of that place, <hi>and it ſhall be that the Firſt-born which ſhe Beareth ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the name of his Brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of</hi> Iſrael, now to attribute that in common to all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98888:92"/> which the Scripture ſo plainly appropriates to one, what is it but to prefer the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a <hi>Rabbin</hi> before that of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lawgiver himſelf? Only thus much I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to have been very true, that in caſe the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> died, then the <hi>next Brother</hi> was to Inherit in the nature of an <hi>adoptive</hi> Son, as the Eldeſt had done before him, and ſo on, if there was more Brothers, and the <hi>Second</hi> died likewiſe as the <hi>Firſt</hi> had done; becauſe without this there would not have been a ſufficient proviſion made for that which was the declared end and deſign of the Law, that <hi>his name be not put out of</hi> Iſrael, and becauſe it is certain if the Elder Brother, I ſpeak now of the <hi>Imputative Father,</hi> died without Iſſue, then the next was to ſucceed in his Bed and in his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as a kind of an <hi>adoptive Husband,</hi> or an <hi>Husband</hi> in his <hi>Brothers ſtead,</hi> as is evident from the ſtory of <hi>Er, Onan,</hi> and <hi>Shelah,</hi> and from the ſtory or ſuppoſition of the Seven <hi>Brethren</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Brethren were uſed to ſucceed one another in their courſe, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the Eldeſt, the Second and ſo on, in the quality of <hi>adoptive</hi> and <hi>vicarious</hi> Husbands, it ſeems to me to depend upon the ſame reaſon and right, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begotten in ſuch a <hi>Leviratical</hi> or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98888:93"/> 
               <hi>Anchiſteutical</hi> Bed, ſhould alſo ſucceed one another upon the deceaſe of the Elder in quality of <hi>adoptive Sons,</hi> or Heirs to the Firſt Husband deceaſed.</p>
            <p>But then if there were no Sons, then the <hi>Daughter Firſt Begotten</hi> was to Inherit, for it is ſtill a great miſtake in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and his <hi>Rabbins,</hi> when they Interpret thoſe words, <hi>If Brethren dwell together and one of them die,</hi> ou ben een Lo, and <hi>hath no Son,</hi> ſo laxly as if it were indifferent either to a Son or Daughter, neither is it any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for him in this caſe, that the 70 and the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> have rendered it in ſuch general words, by <gap reason="foreign">

And it ſhall be that the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born which ſhe beareth, &amp;c.</hi> that this by the propriety of the Sacred Language is to be underſtood only of the <hi>Male iſſue.</hi> As it is <hi>Exod. 11. 5.

            </p>
            <p>Now that by the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> who were Smitten by the deſtroying Angel only the <hi>Males</hi> are to be underſtood, I argue from the Separation of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in memory of this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Exod. 13. 2. Sanctifie unto me all the</hi> Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, <hi>whatſoever openeth the Womb among the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Now if it be proved that only the <hi>Males</hi> were ſanctified, then it is clear that none but the <hi>Males</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98888:94"/> and that by the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> none but the <hi>Males</hi> are to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>I confeſs the Phraſe of <hi>Opening the Womb</hi> is a little general and does extend to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> as well as <hi>Males.</hi> But it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that it depends upon what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Bibnei Jiſrael,</hi> which I take here in the moſt ſtrict and proper ſenſe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or whoſoever of the <hi>Sons</hi> or <hi>Males of</hi> Iſrael firſt openeth the Womb, that is, is <hi>Firſt-born.</hi> And ſo <hi>Exod. 21. 29.

Behold I have taken the</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:98888:95"/> Levites <hi>from among the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>inſtead of all the Firſt-born that openeth the Matrix among the Children of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Therefore the</hi> Levites <hi>ſhall be mine, becauſe all the Firſt-born are mine, for on the day that I ſmote all the Firſt-born in the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>I hallowed unto me all the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in</hi> Iſrael <hi>both Man and Beaſt: mine they ſhall be, I am the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in what ſenſe it was that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> were ſet apart, and what they were obliged to do by ſuch their ſeparation is expreſſed <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. of the ſame chapter, in theſe words: <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, bring the Tribe of</hi> Levi <hi>near, and preſent them before</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt, that they may Miniſter unto him, and they ſhall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole Congregation before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the charge of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do the Service of the Tabernacle.</hi> The ſame you have likewiſe repeated again, <hi>c.</hi> 8. of the ſame Book. It is clear then if <hi>Miniſtring to the Sanctuary</hi> and doing the Service of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> be all that is meant by the <hi>Levites</hi> being ſet apart, and all that they were obliged to do by vertue of ſuch their ſeparation, that the ſeparation of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> whoſe perſons the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98888:95"/> 
               <hi>Levites</hi> did in this caſe repreſent, was of the ſame Nature, that is, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to a ſort of <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> and their buſineſs was to be converſant about the Holy things.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Women</hi> were never admitted into the <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> or ſet apart to the <hi>Miniſtry of the Altar,</hi> either before the <hi>Law</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, any more than they are now under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> therefore it is plain that by the Separation or Sanctification of the <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> only that of the Males is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Women</hi> were at liberty to Marry out of one Tribe into another, ſo as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſcended of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> might Marry if ſhe ſo pleaſed into that of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> or <hi>Judah,</hi> but by ſo doing the <hi>band of Matrimony</hi> unites her much more ſtrongly to her Husband and his Tribe, than to that Tribe of which ſhe was deſcended, ſo that this, if they had been ſeparated would have been a kind of alienation from the ſervice of God, for that they did ſo Marry is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the caſe of the Daughters of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehad,</hi> who were hindred from Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into another Tribe, not becauſe it was in its ſelf unlawful or not uſually practiſed, but to preſerve the Inheritance from being alienated for ever from that Tribe to which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98888:96"/> it formerly belonged, and the Daughters of the other Tribes were with difficulty and by ſuch another wile, as that by which the <hi>Romans</hi> took them Wives of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> granted to the <hi>Benjamites</hi> after the great ſlaughter, not becauſe it was unlawful ſimply conſidered, and in its ſelf, but becauſe the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſworn, ſaying, <hi>curſed be he that giveth a Wife to Benjamin, Jud.</hi> 21. 18. In other caſes it was rather a Duty than a thing unlawful for the Tribes to intermarry with one another, becauſe ſuch Intermarriages are naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a ſtrict friendſhip and unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which was the reaſon why ſuch Marriages were by the Law forbidden with <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> People, for fear that friendſhip and good underſtanding, which this would produce, might be a means to tempt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their Duty, to make them Eat of their Sacrifices, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file themſelves with all their abominations.</p>
            <p>Neither was there any Law as I conceive, of more uſe to the Aggrandizing of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, by abating ſomewhat of thoſe perpetual heats betwixt the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> of which it was compoſed, than that which was at length paſſed by the Wiſdome and activity of one of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, <hi>de maritandis ordinibus,</hi> whereby
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98888:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Patricii</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> were allowed to Intermarry with one another betwixt whom before that time there was kept ſo ſacred &amp; ſo unviolable a diſtance.

            <p>But this is not all, the inſtitution of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover, is a ſufficient demonſtration that by the deſtruction of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> that of the Maleswas only meant, for the Paſſover which was afterwards a commemoration of this
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98888:97"/> deliverance, and was in its firſt inſtitution uſed by way of atonement, to procure it, by Sprinkling the Blood upon the Poſts of the Houſes, by which the deſtroying Angel was to paſs, was to be a <hi>Male</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Year,</hi> a <hi>Male</hi> as being an atonement for a <hi>Male</hi> and of the <hi>Firſt Year</hi> to be an atonement for the <hi>Firſt-born.</hi> To which purpoſe it is likewiſe ſaid, <hi>Exod. 13. 12. Thou ſhalt ſet apart unto the Lord, all that openeth the Matrix and every Firſtling that cometh of a Beaſt, which thou haſt, the Male ſhall be the Lords.</hi> And again, <hi>v. 14. 15. And it ſhall be when thy Son asketh thee in time to come, ſaying, what is this? that thou ſhalt ſay unto him, by ſtrength of hand the Lord brought us out of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>from the Houſe of Bondage. And it came to paſs when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>would hardly let us go, that the Lord ſlew all the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>in the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>both the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>of Men and the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>of Beaſt, therefore I ſacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, being Males, but all the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>of my Children I redeem.</hi> For this reaſon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the <hi>Meat-Offering</hi> was to be eaten by the <hi>Males</hi> only of the Children of <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Females,</hi> as I have ſaid, were not ſet apart to the Miniſtry of the Altar, <hi>Levit. 6. 18. All the Males among the Children of</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall eat of it, it ſhall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98888:97"/> be a ſtatute for ever in your Generations, concerning the Offerings of the Lord made by Fire, every one that toucheth them ſhall be Holy, i. e.</hi> not only purified with all the <hi>Moſaick</hi> ways of luſtration, but actually ſet apart to be employed about the Holy things, which were hallowed unto the Lord, which it ſeems by this place, the <hi>Females</hi> were not, though of the Houſe of <hi>Aaron.</hi> So alſo it is expresſly ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the treſpaſs Offerings, <hi>Levit. 7. 6. Every Male among the Prieſts ſhall eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it ſhall be eaten in the Holy place, it is moſt Holy.</hi> And as the Females were always excluded from the number of thoſe that were ſeparated in ſtead of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> ſo the Males even from a Month old and upwards were all taken into the Muſter, <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 28. ſpeaking of the Males of the Family of <hi>Kohath,</hi> and the ſame is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of other Families. <hi>In the number of all the Males, from a Month old and upwards were Eight Thouſand Six Hundred keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge of the Sanctuary.</hi> So then it is clear that none but the <hi>Males</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Account, and none but they had the <hi>charge of the Sanctuary</hi> committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And to fill up the demonſtration, and make it to all intents and purpoſes compleat and perfect, in the 46. <hi>verſe</hi> of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98888:98"/> the ſame <hi>chapter,</hi> we find the Number of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> in the <hi>other Tribes,</hi> who were to be repreſented by the <hi>Levites,</hi> did exceed the Number of the <hi>Levites</hi> themſelves, by Two hundred ſeventy three perſons, for whom therefore there was an other way of Redemption found, than that of their ſeparation to the Miniſtry of the Tabernacle, either by themſelves or by their Proxies the <hi>Levites,</hi> which was, that they were to pay Five Shekels apiece, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Shekel of the Sanctuary, each Shekel conſiſting of 20 Gerahs, for the uſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>v.</hi> 47, 48. which was accordingly done and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the manner aforeſaid, <hi>as the Lord had commanded Moſes, v.</hi> 49, 50, 51.</p>
            <p>From whence it is very plain, not only that none of the <hi>Levites</hi> were reckoned, but the Males, but that they repreſented none but ſuch, in the other Tribes: For if you conſider, that the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was one of the <hi>Thirteen,</hi> all the Males of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> will be in a manner of an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> being Males of the other Tribes, for the exceſs of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeventy three, is only accidental in its ſelf one way or other, and is not much ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way in ſo large an account as this.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:98888:98"/>
            <p>But you will ſay it is an equal chance, take one with another, whether a Male or Female be Born firſt in any houſe or Family, and therefore if only the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Males of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the Females were not taken into the account nor had any to repreſent them, then the number of the <hi>Levites</hi> would be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner double to the number of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> in the <hi>other Tribes:</hi> But to this I Anſwer; that in ſuch caſes the Female indeed was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of the account, but the next Male to her was taken in as the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> and ſo the Account will be adjuſted again. If you ask me how I prove this, have a little patience and I will tell you.</p>
            <p>You muſt know therefore that the <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> of all <hi>Beaſts</hi> as well <hi>clean</hi> as <hi>unclean,</hi> were to be ſet apart, as well as the <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> the clean for Sacrifice and the unclean to be redeemed with Mony. Now it is expresſly aſſerted in the Law it ſelf, as hath been already ſhewn, that none but Males were either to be Sacrificed or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; what therefore if the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of any Beaſt, whether clean or unclean, ſhall prove a Female, ſhall not the next Male be eſteemed as the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> in this caſe? And is not this much more reaſonable to ſuppoſe than that God ſhould loſe his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98888:99"/> Sacrifice, or the Prieſts their portion? Nay, is it not expresſly aſſerted that it was to be ſo? <hi>Numb. 3. 40. The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Number all the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>of the Males of the Children of</hi> Iſrael; now he might be the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of the Males, the <hi>Firſt-born in ſuo genere,</hi> who was not ſo <hi>abſolutè,</hi> or the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of all the Children: It is clear therefore, that in caſe a Daughter were really the Eldeſt, yet ſhe was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the notion of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> which belonged only to the Firſt of the Males, <hi>i. e.</hi> to her next Brother or to the Eldeſt Son that ſhould be born after her; now the ſame was the caſe both of Cattel and Men, and for the ſame reaſon, ſo that theſe things do mutually ſtrengthen and confirm one another, <hi>v.</hi> 41. of the ſame Chapter. <hi>And thou ſhalt take the</hi> Levites, <hi>for me (I am the Lord) inſtead of all the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Cattel of the</hi> Levites <hi>inſtead of all the Cattel of the Children of</hi> Iſrael. All which will be yet further evident from <hi>Deut. 21. v. 15, 16, 17. If a Man have two Wives, one beloved and another hated, and they have born him Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, both the beloved and the hated, then it ſhall be when he maketh his Sons to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit that which he hath, that he may not make the Son of the beloved</hi> Firſt-born <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98888:99"/> the Son of the hated, which is indeed the</hi> Firſt-born, <hi>but he ſhall acknowledge the Son of the hated for the</hi> Firſt-born, <hi>by giving him a double portion of all that he hath, for he is the beginning of his ſtrength, the right of the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>is his.</hi> From which place I argue thus: Whoever had the right of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> and was to receive a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, that the Father poſſeſſed, he or ſhe was in the Interpretation of the Law, and conſequently in the Language of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and in all thoſe Laws where mention is made of the <hi>Firſt-born, the Firſt-born;</hi> but this was not the <hi>Firſt-born Child,</hi> but the <hi>Eldeſt Son:</hi> Therefore in caſe a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were born before him, it is neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intention of the Law, and the practice of thoſe times, that ſhe ſhould be omitted out of the account; for a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, in caſe there were any Male ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the death of the Parent, was ſo far from having a double portion which was the right of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> that ſhe was not to Inherit at all, <hi>Numb. 27. 8. If a man die and have no Son, then ſhall he cauſe his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to paſs unto his Daughter.</hi> But in no other caſe unleſs you ſuppoſe this Law to be in vain: It is manifeſt therefore all along, that by the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> the <hi>Eldeſt Son</hi> is meant, again, <hi>for he is the beginning of his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98888:100"/> ſtrength,</hi> which is the very expreſſion of <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning his Eldeſt Son <hi>Reuben, Gen.</hi> 49. And the meaning of it is this, that the Eldeſt Son was in the nature of all <hi>primitiae</hi> or firſt Fruits, dedicated unto the Lord, only with this difference, that all other <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> were dedicated in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but he in the quality of a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Now as I have ſaid, it is plain that Women were never admitted into the <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> either before the Law or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and before it as hath been ſaid, the Eldeſt Brother was both the King and the Prieſt of the Family, for theſe two cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were of Ancient time commonly united in the ſame perſon, as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was <hi>King of</hi> Salem, <hi>and Prieſt of the moſt High God;</hi> As is evident from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, and from this, that after the expulſion of their Kings they had their <hi>Reges Sacrificuli,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to execute thoſe parts of the Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which belonged formerly to the <hi>Kings of Rome.</hi> And as has been a thouſand times obſerved out of that known Verſe,</p>

            <p>For which reaſon it is that when <hi>Jacob</hi> calls <hi>Reuhen</hi> the <hi>beginning of his ſtrength,</hi> he adds to it, after an exegetical, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planative manner, <hi>the excellency of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the excellency of Power;</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which expreſſions the <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> and in the latter the <hi>King-ſhip</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, though <hi>Reuben</hi> had forfeited them both for a reaſon already mentioned ſeems to have been contained. And that this ſeparating of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> was in the nature of <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> in Ancient times as well as it was afterwards for another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon likewiſe, will appear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 29. where the ſeparating the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> and of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Firſt-Fruits are evidently compared together. <hi>Thou ſhalt not delay to offer the firſt of thy ripe Fruits and of thy Liquors; the</hi> Firſt-born <hi>of thy Sons
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98888:101"/> ſhalt thou give unto me.</hi> If then the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fathers ſtrength, and the</hi> Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, were all one, and if the <hi>beginning or</hi> Primitiae <hi>of the Fathers ſtrength,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was nor could be a Daughter, but muſt always be a Son, then it is manifeſt that the ſame thing muſt be underſtood likewiſe of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> which was the thing in queſtion.</p>
            <p>There are two things, I foreſee, may be objected againſt what has been ſaid; the firſt is this; Suppoſe a man had but <hi>one</hi> Child, and that a <hi>Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whether this were to be taken into the liſt of the <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> to which I anſwer in the negative, that ſhe was not, and I give this reaſon; Either he had an Inheritance to beſtow, or he had not; if the latter, then it is manifeſt the Woman was not conſidered, as of that Family of which ſhe was deſcended, but was to paſs into another by Marriage, or dye uſeleſs and unregarded in a ſingle life, from whence it came to paſs that Women as I have obſerved already, had their names from <hi>oblivion</hi> and were called <hi>Naſhim,</hi> as on the contrary the men are <hi>Zecarim</hi> from <hi>remembrance</hi> becauſe they carry on and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the memory of their Fore-Fathers in their Inheritance and in their perſons.</p>
            <p>But then upon Suppoſition that there
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98888:101"/> was an Inheritance left behind to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome body after his deceaſe, yet it would not have fallen to his <hi>Daughter,</hi> at that time when the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſet apart inſtead of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> but to the next of Kin, the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt inſtance of Womens inheriting in the ſacred ſtory, and it appears that at that time it was a new thing and never heard of before, therefore they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Moſes</hi> for a remedy of this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the Female Sex, and complain of it as a very unreaſonable thing, <hi>Num. 27. v. 2, 3, 4. And they</hi> (the Daughters of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehad) <hi>ſtood before</hi> Moſes <hi>and before</hi> Eleazar <hi>the Prieſt, and before the Princes of all the Congregation, by the door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation, ſaying, our Father died in the Wilderneſs, and he was not in the company of them that gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together againſt the Lord in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of</hi> Korah, <hi>but died in his own ſin, and had no Sons, why ſhould the name of our Father be done away from his Family becauſe he hath no Son? Give unto us therefore a poſſeſſion among the Brethren of our Father.</hi> Which petition of theirs, however reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it might appear in its ſelf, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> could not grant it, till he had firſt brought their cauſe before the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 5. from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98888:102"/> whom he received this anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. in which the <hi>Moſaick</hi> platform of Succeſſions to the Inheritance or goods of the deceaſed is contained: <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Zelophehad <hi>ſpeak right: Thou ſhalt ſurely give them a poſſeſſion of an Inheritance among their Fathers Brethren, thou ſhalt cauſe the Inheritance of their Father to paſs unto them, and thou ſhalt ſpeak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, if a man die and have no Son, then he ſhall cauſe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to paſs unto his Daughter, and if he have no Daughter, then he ſhall give his Inheritance unto his Brethren, and if he have no Brethren, then he ſhall give his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance unto his Fathers Brethren, and if his Father have no Brethren, then he ſhall give his Inheritance to his Kinſman, that is next to him of his Family, and he ſhall poſſeſs it, and it ſhall be unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>a ſtatute of Judgment, as the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes.</p>
            <p>By which words it is manifeſt, as well from the expoſtulation of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> as from the anſwer of God to the remonſtrance of <hi>Moſes</hi> made in their behalf, that Daughters before that time were in no caſe to Inherit the Land of their deceaſed Fathers, for it would
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98888:102"/> have been a very Idle queſtion, <hi>why ſhould the name of our Father be done away from his Family becauſe he hath no Son?</hi> and as needleſs a demand, <hi>give unto us therefore a poſſeſſion among the Brethren of our Father,</hi> if the Daughters by the cuſtom and uſage of theſe times, had had in default of Male Iſſue, a true and proper right of Inheritance to the eſtate of the deceaſed: Which is yet farther plain from this, that <hi>Moſes</hi> durſt not of himſelf adventure to aſſign them a poſſeſſion among the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of their Father, till he had firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted God what was to be done, in a caſe in which he had no Law; nor any example but what would be to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Petitioners to govern himſelf by; and by the anſwer of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> it appears plainly, that the Inheritance of Sons was then ſufficiently provided for, <hi>v. 8. If a man die and have no Son;</hi> in which words the Inheritance of the Son is ſuppoſed, in caſe the deceaſing party left any, but for that of the Daughter and of the collateral relations, it was not yet ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as is plain from that expreſs proviſion which is here made in that behalf, and from thoſe words at the cloſe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, <hi>v. 11. And it ſhall be unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael a ſtatute of Judgment:</hi> Which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98888:103"/> words might well enough have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as well as the ſcruple, the conſultation, the anſwer and all that went before, if theſe things had been unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a <hi>ſtatute of Judgment</hi> before that time.</p>
            <p>Now if you examine at what time this Law was made, the Chapter wherein it is contained will tell you, that it was after fourty years ſojourning in the Wilderneſs, when all that Generation which came out of <hi>Aegypt, Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf only excepted, were actually dead and gone, and when <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was about to follow the reſt, and to reſign up his Government, together with his life, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the hands of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun.</hi> Which being long after the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſet apart to the Miniſtry of the Sanctuary inſtead of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> it is plain that in thoſe liſts of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> which were then taken, there was no mention made of any <hi>Daughter</hi> though the <hi>only</hi> Child, ſhe being neither the <hi>beginning of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtrength,</hi> in that ſenſe in which thoſe words are to be underſtood, as has been ſhewn, neither did the <hi>double portion,</hi> which was the right of the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> (or indeed, as it muſt be in the caſe of an <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Child, all the eſtate) belong to her.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98888:103"/> And though it be true that the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> themſelves had at that time, being in the Wilderneſs, no Inheritance there being as yet no partition made of the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet they were notwithſtanding he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable perſons in the eſteem of Law, and they were going to the actual poſſeſſion of ſuch Inheritances, which none of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that time were.</p>
            <p>But it is enough to ſay without all this elaborate canvaſeing the buſineſs, that the reaſon of the ſeparation of the <hi>Levites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> being to be the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, in their ſtead, and it being manifeſt by the exceſs of <hi>Two hundred and threeſcore and thirteen,</hi> for whom a price of redemption was paid, that every man had his particular repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative aſſigned him at that time, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ridiculous for a <hi>Levite</hi> to repreſent that perſon in the ſervice of the Tabernacle, which its ſelf was excluded from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of intermedling in ſuch affairs, which I have ſhewn Women always to have been, it is demonſtration that not being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the <hi>Levites,</hi> they were not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned in the number of the <hi>Firſt-born.</hi> Thus far therefore it is undenyably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that by the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> the Male, and the <hi>Male only</hi> is to be underſtood.</p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:98888:104"/>
            <p>This is the Firſt Objection; the Second is this: There were <hi>Firſt-born</hi> among the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> themſelves too, how therefore ſhall we do in this caſe? were they ſet apart for their own ſakes and for the ſake of others whom they repreſented alſo? This ſeems to be not only needleſs, but in a manner impoſſible, for when you have done all, they can be but ſet apart to ſuch a ſervice, and that they are as effectually one way as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And which ſoever of theſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Firſt, the real or the vicarious perſon, ſeems for that reaſon to exclude the other.</p>
            <p>But to this I anſwer, that whatſoever the <hi>Levites</hi> were with reſpect of their office, was perfectly by way of repreſentation, they were nothing in themſelves, they had no inheritance, neither were they conſidered as a part of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Numb. 1. 48, 49. <hi>The Lord had ſpoken unto</hi> Moſes <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou ſhalt not remember the Tribe of</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, <hi>neither take the ſum of them among the Children of</hi> Iſrael. Numb. 18. 20. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>thou ſhalt have no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in their Land, neither ſhalt thou have any part among them I am thy part and thine inheritance among the Children of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And</hi> ver. 24. <hi>The tithes of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>which they offer as an heave offering unto the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98888:104"/> Lord, I have given the</hi> Levites <hi>to inherit. Therefore I have ſaid unto them, among the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>they ſhall have no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Laſtly, c. 26. 62. <hi>And thoſe that were numbered of them</hi> (of the Levites) <hi>were 23000, all Males from a month old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for they were not numbred among the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>becauſe there was no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance given them among the Children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe of the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> and of its being always reſtrained and confined to the Male iſſue, with that place of <hi>Zech. 12. 10. They ſhall mourn for him as one that mourneth for his only Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him as one that is in bitterneſs for his</hi> Firſt-born, where it is evident that the <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> in the <hi>latter</hi> clauſe being only <hi>exegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> of the <hi>onely ſon</hi> in the <hi>former,</hi> and it being a <hi>proverbial</hi> ſpeech expreſſive of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of grief and ſorrow, which in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will and ought to be greater for the loſs of a <hi>Male</hi> that might have continued the name and memory of the deceaſing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, than of a Female from whom this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage cannot be obtained, it is in both of theſe reſpects clear, that the word there is reſtrained to the <hi>Male Iſſue;</hi> and look whatever is the ſenſe of a word in a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial</hi> way of ſpeech as this is, that is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98888:105"/> the general acceptation of that word in all examples of the ſame Language. And indeed I think I may after all this ſafely challenge any man to ſhew me one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where the word <hi>Bacor,</hi> I do not ſpeak becauſe it is of the <hi>maſculine</hi> gender, for notwithſtanding that, its ſignification might be <hi>Epicaene</hi> in many caſes, I ſay, I may, and do challenge any man to ſhew me one inſtance where it is not reſtrained to denote only the <hi>Male kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How unreaſonable then muſt it needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to Interpret it in this place of <hi>Deut.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole Current of its accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the Bible beſides. Eſpecially if you conſider that it has <hi>ben</hi> immediately joyned with it in the former verſe, <hi>ov ben een Lo. And he have no Son,</hi> which word as I conceive, in the <hi>ſingular</hi> number is never ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as to denote both ſexes, though in the <hi>plurative</hi> ſometimes it may, as when they ſay <hi>bnei Adam,</hi> or <hi>bnei Iſrael</hi> the <hi>Sons of Men,</hi> or of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is in theſe inſtances comprehenſive of both ſexes, but in the <hi>Singular</hi> number I believe you will very rarely meet with it ſo, though two inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces indeed I do now remember, as I am writing, but then the word is in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> with a caſe, it is not put alone as it is here. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98888:105"/> lye, nor the Son of man that he ſhould repent.</hi> And again, <hi>what is Man that thou art mindful of him, or the Son of Man that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> But this being not the caſe here, and it being ſo nearly placed to another word, which is never uſed but of the <hi>Male Sex,</hi> which two words do plainly refer to one another. <hi>Habecor, v.</hi> 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as <hi>Ben habecor,</hi> becauſe the reaſon of the Womans Marriage to the Brother of the deceaſed was <hi>chi ben een Lo,</hi> becauſe her former Husband had no <hi>Son.</hi> I think all this more than <hi>one</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that the <hi>Male</hi> is only to be underſtood in this place.</p>
            <p>Thus have I done with my firſt argument taken from the ſignification of the word <hi>Firſt-born</hi> in the Language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to prove that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and thoſe <hi>Hebrew Gentlemen,</hi> whom he is pleaſed to follow, are miſtaken when they interpret thoſe words, <hi>ov ben een Lo (and he have no Son</hi>) indifferently to <hi>either</hi> Sex. I will now confirm what I have ſaid by a ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which cannot be reſiſted, and which I have already mentioned in my diſcourſe upon the former <hi>medium,</hi> and that is, that this Law was made in the Wilderneſs long before the delivery of that Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. of which I have already
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98888:106"/> ſpoken, by which Women were firſt made capable of Inheriting; if then Women could not Inherit when this Law was made, if the deſign of the Law was, <hi>to raiſe up the name of the dead upon his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:</hi> And if by that nothing elſe be meant but that the <hi>vicarious</hi> Offspring ſhould Inherit in his Right and Title, then it is manifeſt that he who died leaving no <hi>Male</hi> Iſſue, though he had Female, had not yet made ſufficient proviſion for the <hi>raiſing up his name upon his Inheritance,</hi> or which is all one, for hindring his name from being <hi>blotted</hi> out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or being <hi>done away</hi> from his <hi>Family</hi> or from the <hi>gate of his place,</hi> therefore the reaſon of this Law ſtill remaining, (notwithſtanding the Female Iſſue) the relict of the deceaſed might ſtill demand his Brother or near Kinſman in Marriage for the aforeſaid end. And if the true and real Daughter of the deceaſed was not to Inherit, much leſs was the Firſt Child of the <hi>Leviratical</hi> or <hi>Vicarious</hi> Bed, if it proved a <hi>Daughter</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, becauſe it could have no right but what it received from the adoptive Father, and he that gave no right of Inheritance to his <hi>real,</hi> muſt much leſs be ſuppoſed to have done it to his <hi>imputative</hi> Offspring. It is true indeed that by the Law of <hi>Num.</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:98888:106"/> 27. a <hi>Daughter</hi> was afterwards made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Inheriting, but in regard there were great inconveniences attending inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of this nature, the Eſtate by this means going out of the direct line into a collateral Houſe of the ſame Family or Tribe, all which was directly contrary to one of the main deſigns running through the <hi>whole tenor</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Laws, which had ſo particular reſpect in many caſes, to the preſerving the Inheritance in the ſame Houſe and Line, that I conceive the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did never legally Inherit, but in one of the following caſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the Wife deceaſed before her Husband, who left only Female Iſſue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. Secondly, If at her Husbands deceaſe ſhe were paſt the years of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing. Thirdly, If Marrying again in purſuance of the <hi>Leviratical Sanction</hi> ſhe had no Iſſue, or none but Female, or if upon the refuſal of the Kindred ſhe Married into another Houſe: In all theſe caſes or the like, if any more can be thought of, the Female was to Inherit, and in none elſe as I conceive, becauſe the Law in <hi>Numbers</hi> was not certainly intended to invalidate or weaken thoſe other Laws, by which the continuance of the Inheritance in the ſame houſe, was ſo carefuly provided for.</p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:98888:107"/>
            <p>Wherefore if they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> refuſed to Marry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Family or Tribe, they were in ſuch caſe to leave the Inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and ſuffer it to go to the next of Kin, to whom upon their death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue it would have deſcended, <hi>Joſeph.

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>For indeed all thoſe Laws of ſettlement mentioned <hi>Num.</hi> 27. ſeem to me to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an addition or an explanatory Act ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that of <hi>Deut.</hi> by which, as in the firſt place, there is no manner of care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Inheritance of Daughters, ſo only the <hi>Husbands Brother,</hi> properly ſo called, is expresſly there warranted to Marry his deceaſed Brothers Wife, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Law of <hi>Num.</hi> it is provided if a man had <hi>no Brethren,</hi> that the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould go to his <hi>Fathers Brethren,</hi> and for want of ſuch to the <hi>next of Kin</hi> of the ſame Family; and the reaſon of the Brothers Marrying the Brothers Wife, in an imputative and adoptive way, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the preſervation of the Inheritance in the ſame Houſe or Line, it ſeems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe, that all who had a <hi>legal</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98888:107"/> right to the <hi>Inheritance</hi> had alſo the ſame right to Marry the <hi>Widow</hi> of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for though none were ſo much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to perform this part as the Brother himſelf, yet the Marriage of the Brothers Wife being death in other caſes by the ſame Law, it is clear, it is a leſs diſpen, ſation, or a leſs violence done to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of things, to ſuffer a <hi>Kinſman farther off,</hi> than an <hi>immediate Brother</hi> to Marry the relict of the deceaſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he being moſt obliged, the firſt challenge was to be made to him, and there being ſomewhat of a priviledge in it, by Inheriting the double portion, he as the very next of Kin had the firſt right of refuſal. From all which I conclude, that this was the true reaſon why the 70 make uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the place of <hi>Deut.</hi> it ſelf, to ſhew that this right was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards extended farther, than the words as they are ſet down in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> may at firſt view ſeem to allow, and that it was in purſuance of this Law in <hi>Deuter:</hi> as it is explained and enlarged by that of <hi>Numbers,</hi> that the march between <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> was afterwards made.</p>
            <p>But that I may not ſeem to oppoſe Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and his <hi>Rabbins</hi> in every thing they ſay, as it were out of a Spirit of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98888:108"/> contradiction, which no man is more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally averſe from than my ſelf, being always a favourer of that ſide where I ſee the greateſt appearance of truth. I will now acknowledge that in one thing they determine with great probability of reaſon, and that is, when they tell us that the Law of the <hi>Leviratus</hi> was to be underſtood only of the <hi>Brothers Germans</hi> or of the Kindred of the <hi>Fathers ſide,</hi> but that the <hi>Maternal Conſanguinity</hi> was not at all concerned in it; the words of Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> are theſe, p. 100. <hi>De fratribus autem uterinis Lex haec non intelligenda eſt, ſed tantum de Germanis, nam ut ad invicem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimè ſuccedunt uterini, ita nec hac lege te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur.</hi> And of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> cited in the ſame place by Mr. <hi>Selden, Achin Min Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eem eenan chaſhoubin Achin,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Brothers by the Mothers ſide are not</hi> in the Interpretation of Law <hi>looked upon as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> either with relation to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or to the Marriage of the deceaſed Brothers Wife, but they are as to both theſe matters, as if they were not Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at all, <hi>neither is there any Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood but what is from the ſame Father.</hi> Which things are all clear and certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all colourable ground of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for if the Inheritance deſcend
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98888:108"/> legally from Father to Son, or Daughter, or in defect of ſuch paſs on to the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Relations obliquely aſcending or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending on the Fathers ſide, then it is clear that they whoſe blood does not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſame <hi>Paternal</hi> Conſanguinity cannot have a Title to the ſame Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; and the intention of Marryings of this nature, being to <hi>raiſe up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance,</hi> there is no reaſon why the Widow might not be at liberty to Marry whom ſhe pleaſed to this end, if ſhe might Marry him who had no relation to the Inheritance its ſelf, which was the caſe of a <hi>Brother by the Mothers ſide.</hi> Again, upon ſuppoſition that the Brother of the deceaſed by the Mothers ſide did Marry this Widow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Marriage did bar the <hi>paternal</hi> Kindred from a legal Title or Claim to the Inheritance, or it did not; if it did not, then the deſign of this Marriage was in vain, for he would not <hi>raiſe up the Name of the dead upon that Inheritance</hi> which was not in his poſſeſſion, and with which he had nothing to do; if he did, then the <hi>Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Kindred had a better Claim to the <hi>Paternal</hi> Inheritance, than thoſe who were deſcended of, or were by Conſanguinity related to the ſame Father, upon whoſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98888:109"/> Title all other claims muſt depend, which is abſurd, it being as much as to ſay, they had, and they had not a right at the ſame time; but then, if he could not bring the Inheritance along with him, it was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Widow to Marry him at all, as appears by undeniable conſequences from <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 9. the deceaſed Husbands Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uterine, being conſidered as her own half Brother, which is the ſame thing as for a Brother to Marry his half Siſter, which was forbidden by the Law.</p>
            <p>Again, if none could Marry the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for the purpoſe aforeſaid, of hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of the deceaſed from being <hi>blotted out,</hi> and of <hi>raiſing up the name of the dead upon his Inheritance,</hi> but he that had a right of redeeming the ſaid Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and if none had a right of redeeming the inheritance but the Kindred deſcending from, or centring in the ſame <hi>paternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity,</hi> then it is manifeſt that this Law could not be extended to the half Brother of the deceaſed by the Mothers ſide. But the connexion of theſe two is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf when he gives this as a reaſon why the Brother of the deceaſed by the Mothers ſide could not Marry his Widow. <hi>Nam ut ad invicem minime ſuccedunt uterini, ita nec hac lege
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98888:109"/> tenentur.</hi> And <hi>Maimonides</hi> alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the ſame, by putting them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Fratres uterini,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>non cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentur pro fratribus, Lehinjan jerouſhah, ou Lehinjan jibboum vechalitſa, vel in causâ haereditatis, vel in leviratu.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more ſhould not have granted this, yet the Scripture it ſelf would ſufficiently have proved it, for I have ſhewn <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 48. 49. to belong as well to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Inheritances as perſons, and in that place, we have theſe words: <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is ſold he may be redeemed again: one of his Brethren may redeem him. Either his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle or his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son may redeem him, or if he be able he may redeem himſelf;</hi> where that only <hi>Paternal</hi> Kindred is to be meant, may be proved by undeniable arguments.</p>
            <p>As for the ſignification of <hi>Echad Meachau v. 48. unus ex fratribus ejus,</hi> though nothing can certainly be inferred from it, if nothing elſe were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, yet when in the next verſe we are told that either <hi>Dodo or ben Dodo</hi> his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> or his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son</hi> may do the ſame, there are theſe two things to be obſerved; Firſt, That <hi>Dod</hi> does properly ſignifie the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> by the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſide, not <hi>Avunculus</hi> but <hi>Patru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and ſo the vulgar Latin renders it, the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98888:110"/> 70, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>ben Dodo</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Son</hi> muſt both of them be underſtood of the Fathers ſide, then it is but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conclude that the <hi>Brother</hi> alſo in the former verſe, muſt be underſtood the ſame way. Secondly, or <hi>any</hi> that is <hi>nigh of Kin</hi> to him of his Family may redeem him. Here there are two things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>any of his near Fleſh,</hi> or <hi>any of his own Fleſh,</hi> now the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>mans own Fleſh,</hi> is not that of his <hi>Mother,</hi> but his <hi>Father</hi> with whom his <hi>Mother</hi> by Marriage is made <hi>one,</hi> and his Family is looked upon as hers, and if after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe ſhe ſhall marry another, then that Child which ſhe ſhall conceive and bear by the ſecond Husband is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter</hi> of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> no more than her <hi>ſecond Huſband</hi> is, to whom ſhe is now <hi>united,</hi> having forſaken her former Family, and is become <hi>one Fleſh</hi> with <hi>him.</hi> Secondly, he was not only to be <hi>near of Kin, i. e. of the ſame Fleſh,</hi> as both the Original and the 70 more exactly ſpeak,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98888:110"/> but it is added likewiſe, <hi>any that is nigh unto him of his Family may redeem him.</hi> Now a man is of his <hi>Fathers Family,</hi> not his <hi>Mothers,</hi> who quits her <hi>own Family</hi> and her <hi>Fathers houſe</hi> by Marriage. It is plain therefore that none had a right of redemption, nor conſequently of Marriage with the deceaſed, but only the Kindred of the deceaſed by the Fathers ſide. But this is not all, there was another reaſon as I have often ſaid, of performing the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands part to the Widow of the deceaſed, beſides the redemption of the Inheritance, and that was the <hi>ſervitude</hi> or <hi>ſubjection</hi> under which the <hi>Younger</hi> was in ancient time to the <hi>Elder;</hi> but this ſubjection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt in the ſame common Father, who had a deſpotical power over all his Sons, and under him the Eldeſt had a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the reſt, as repreſenting the perſon and Inheriting the fortune of his Father, but now he that is born of a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi> Father, though of the <hi>ſame</hi> Mother, it is manifeſt he belongs to <hi>another Houſe,</hi> and is to be looked upon as a ſubject of a <hi>different Kingdom;</hi> ſo that it cannot be in either reſpect, either with relation to the Inheritance of the deceaſed, or in regard of that Duty and Subjection which the Younger ows to the Elder, that the half
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98888:111"/> Brother by the Mothers ſide ſhould raiſe up Seed to the deceaſed Brother; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the plain evidence and down-right concluſiveneſs of what has been ſaid, the ſpeech of <hi>Naomi</hi> to her two Daughters in the ſtory of <hi>Ruth</hi> ſeems at leaſt to be a ſuppoſition of the legality of a contrary practice. <hi>c. 1. v 12, 13. Turn again, my Daughters, go your way for I am too old to have a Husband, If I ſhould ſay, I have hope, if I ſhould have a Husband alſo to night and ſhould alſo bear Sons, would you tarry for them till they were grown? would ye ſtay for them from having Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands? nay, my Daughters, for it grieveth me much for your ſakes, that the hand of the Lord is gone out againſt me.</hi> This difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has very much baffled the endeavours of Learned Men. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> upon this occaſion hath theſe words, <hi>Ruth 1. 11. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> Naomi <hi>ad nurus ſuas,</hi> Orpha <hi>&amp;</hi> Ruth, <hi>viduas, nec prole beatas; An adhuo, inquit, intra me, in utero meo ſunt filii, qui fiant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riti veſtri? perinde ac ſi non ſolum ad fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem uterinum ſed etiam ad eum qui mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis fraternae tempore, nondum in lucem fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat editus (quod itidem uno ore negant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtri) jus hoc ſpectâſſet, atqui non ex hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſce juris obtentu, ſed ex ingenti erga Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus amore a</hi> Naomi <hi>hoc dictum volunt, ao

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in the ſame place takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of another opinion of <hi>Solomon Jarchi,</hi> but he ſeems to favour this more, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it deſerves, (<hi>Jarchi's</hi> opinion being founded upon a ſuppoſition that <hi>Ruth</hi> was not yet naturaliz'd which I have already <note n="*" place="margin">And ſhe is by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſly call'd a proſelite, Hiſt.

            <p>But neither is this ſo right as it ſhould be, it not being likely that her love to her two Daughters in law ſhould make her ſo far forget the Cuſtom and Uſage of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Therefore let us try ſome other way, and ſee if that will ſucceed any better. <hi>Are there any more Sons in my Womb that they ſhould be your Husbands? I am too old to have a Husband, if I ſhould ſay I have hope, if I ſhould have an Husband alſo to Night, and ſhould alſo bear Sons, would you tarry for them till they were grown? Would you ſtay
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98888:112"/> for them from having Husbands? Nay my Daughters: For it grieveth me for your ſakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out againſt me;</hi> all which queſtions are nothing elſe but an enumeration of ſo many impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to make them deſpair the more, and to make them return back from whence they came. As when God asks <hi>Abraham</hi> whether he could count the <hi>Stars,</hi> or the <hi>Sands of the Sea-ſhore?</hi> It was not upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that this was a poſſible thing, but to let him know that his ſeed ſhould be as numberleſs as they, or when it is ſaid, Can the <hi>Blackmore change his Skin, or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his ſpots?</hi> It is not that theſe things can be done, but to ſhew how hard and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner impoſſible it is for habitual wickedneſs to be reclaimed. And, <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth? i. e.</hi> thou waſt not at all. so here, <hi>Are there more Sons in my Womb?</hi> is as much as poſitively to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm there are not. Again, <hi>that they may be your Husbands,</hi> is as much as to ſay, and if there were, yet you could not marry them. But then again, <hi>I am too old to have an Husband:</hi> If I ſhould marry it would be to no purpoſe for I ſhould have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; again: <hi>If I ſhould have an Husband alſo to Night, and ſhould alſo bear Sons;</hi> nay, and put caſe it were lawful for you to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98888:112"/> Marry them, which yet it would not be, <hi>Would you tarry for them till they were grown? Would ye ſtay for them from having Husbands?</hi> As much as to ſay, you would not, or it would be in vain if you ſhould: For you your ſelves would be paſt Childbearing by that time; and therefore ſhe adds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: <hi>nay, my Daughters,</hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>the hand of the Lord is gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me,</hi> as much as to ſay, it is impoſſible, talk no more, but leave me and go home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Againſt all that hath been ſaid, I know but two things remaining that deſerve an anſwer, the Firſt concerns the main queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> were celebrated in conſequence of that Law in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> by which the Brother was to raiſe up ſeed to his deceaſed Brother, and the Second that which hath been the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubject of this laſt debate, whether in this Law the <hi>Paternal Conſanguinity</hi> were only to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Againſt the Firſt of theſe Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thus, <hi>c. 15. de ſucceſſionibus, Nec ſane exutus hic (Ruth 4. 7.) Calceus ritus eſt, qui ad fratris nuptias attinere poteſt, nam is, ubi ad eas ſpectabat, renuntiationis dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxat ſignum erat quod ſcimus ex Deuter. 25. 9. atqui hic nihil aliud innuit praeter
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98888:113"/> ſolennem quae inoleverat traditionis ſeu ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirendi dominii formulam—neque nuptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum renuntiatio ſed contrà ipſae nuptiae fiunt.</hi> The meaning of which, as plain as I can repreſent it, is this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. v. 7, 8, 9, 10. we have theſe words: <hi>And if the man like not to take his Brothers Wife, then let his Brothers Wife go up to the Gate, unto the Elders, and ſay, My Husbands Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſeth to raiſe up unto his Brother a name in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he will not perform the duty of my Husbands Brother; then the Elders of his City ſhall call him, and ſpeak unto him, and if he ſtand to it and ſay, I like not to take her, then ſhall his Brothers Wife come unto him in the preſence of the Elders, and looſe his ſhoe from off his foot and ſpit in his face, and ſhall anſwer and ſay, ſo ſhall it be done unto the man, that will not build up his Brothers houſe, and his name ſhall be called in</hi> Iſrael <hi>the Houſe of him that hath his ſhoe looſed.</hi> Again <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. it is ſaid. <hi>Now this was the manner in former time in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>concerning redeeming, and concerning chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for to confirm all things: a man plucked off his ſhoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a teſtimony in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>therefore the Kinſman ſaid unto</hi> Boaz, <hi>buy it for thee: ſo he drew off his ſhoe. And</hi> Boaz <hi>ſaid

            </p>
            <p>From theſe two places compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> Argues thus: The pulling off the Shoe in the laſt cited place of <hi>Ruth,</hi> cannot belong to the Law of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> by which the Brother was obliged to raiſe up Seed to the Brother, becauſe in <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> that ceremony ſignified as much, as the Womans renouncing and diſclaimeing her pretenſions to the Brother of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Husband, but in <hi>Ruth</hi> it is nothing elſe but a ſolemn right of taking poſſeſſion, or of acquiring a right or dominion in any thing or perſon, and that this was the uſual <hi>Formula traditionis ſeu acquirendi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minii,</hi> he appeals to the Ancient <hi>Medraſh</hi> upon <hi>Ruth,</hi> that is, he appeals to a <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> or which is all one to a man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98888:114"/> nothing of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, For by Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> favour, there is no manner of repugnancy or diſagreement between theſe two places, that of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> I mean, and that of <hi>Ruth,</hi> only they are two partial or imperfect relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the whole Ceremony or Formality of this affair. From the place of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi> we learn what the Woman was to do, in caſe the man refuſed to accept her challenge, ſhe was to pull off his ſhoe and ſpit in his face; the latter of theſe in token of contempt, and as a mark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, the firſt for a reaſon which I ſhall preſently explain; and on the other ſide, from the place of <hi>Ruth</hi> we are inſtructed, what the man was to do in caſe he did accept the claim and challenge of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">V. Druſ. in Loc.</note> he was to pull off his own ſhoe in the Face of the Congregation, and was with this Ceremony to redeem the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of his deceaſed Kinſman or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was to take her to his Wife, in the preſence of them all.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt know, that this pulling off the ſhoe in thoſe Eaſtern Countries and early ages of the World, was an external Act or expreſſion of divine Worſhip and Honor. So the <hi>Angel</hi> ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Exod. 3. 5. Draw not nigh hither, put off
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98888:114"/> thy ſhoes from off thy Feet, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is Holy ground.</hi> And ſo alſo, <hi>Joſh. 5. 15. The Captain of the Lords Hoſt ſaid unto</hi> Joſhua, <hi>looſe thy ſhoe from off thy Foot, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is Holy:</hi> This is the reaſon why the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day go barefoot into their <hi>Moſchs,</hi> and that it was the cuſtom and practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> at all their Feaſts, we have the Teſtimony of <hi>Juvenal</hi> for it.</p>

            <p>And the <hi>Jews</hi> being commanded to Eat the Paſſover with their ſhoes on, for expedition ſake, that they might be in a readineſs to march, and in remembrance of that haſty departure of their Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they were uſed to ſit down at all their other Feaſts bare-foot or with their ſhoes off, otherwiſe that which was the common practice in all caſes need not have been commanded in a particular inſtance. Wherefore the plain reaſon why the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> pulled off the ſhoe of the refuſer, whom ſhe had challenged, but in vain, to continue the name and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98888:115"/> memory of her deceaſed Husband upon his Inheritance, was, that by this <hi>Symbol</hi> ſhe did appeal to God, and did call him to witneſs, that ſhe had done, what as the ſervant or ſubject of her late Husband, whoſe Family ſhe was bound to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to the utmoſt of her power, ſhe was obliged to do; and ſhe was ſuppoſed alſo by ſpitting in his Face at the ſame time, to imprecate thoſe curſes upon the refuſer, which were the reward of diſobedience to the Law of God, and were but due to him, if he had no tolerable excuſe to plead for himſelf, who was ſo unkind to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his deceaſed Brother: As on the other ſide when the man in <hi>Ruth</hi> pulls off his own Shoe himſelf, and delivers it to his Neighbour, that is, in this caſe to <hi>Ruth</hi> her ſelf, this was an appeal to God or a publick owning in the preſence of God and the World, that he did accept the challenge of the Woman, and did at that time ſolemnly engage before the whole aſſembly, to redeem the Inheritance, from paſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98888:115"/> and this was a Teſtimony in</hi> Iſrael. And <hi>v.</hi> 9.

            <p>I do not deny what Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith, that this delivering of the ſhoe from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was <hi>traditionis ſeu acquirendi Dominii Formula,</hi> the manner of <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>ſeiſin</hi> in thoſe times; but I do not grant thus much becauſe his <hi>Medraſh-monger</hi> tells us ſo, but becauſe it is manifeſt from the plain words of Scripture <hi>Ruth. 4. 7. Now this was the manner in former time in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things: A man plucked off his ſhoe and gave it to his Neighbour, and this was a teſtimony in Iſrael:</hi> but yet I ſay, that the true reaſon of this Ceremony, was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply an appeal to God, to whom this right was uſed to be apply'd as an act of Divine Worſhip, and therefore the inſpired Writer tells us, it was <hi>to confirm all things,</hi> and it was <hi>a teſtimony in</hi> Iſrael, an Oath being the greateſt aſſurance and the moſt ſacred way of plighting our Troth and Faith to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that any man can give.</p>

            <p>Neither do I ſo wholly confine my ſelf to this ſignification of pulling off the ſhoe, as to affirm it had no other; which I am ſo far from, that I conceive, Shoes being never uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor any of thoſe <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern People,</hi> when they were within doors, but only when they walked abroad; for this reaſon the pulling off the Shoe and giving it to another, was a <hi>Symbolical</hi> repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſſing of the inheritance from one to another, as in this caſe when <hi>Boaz</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the inheritance of <hi>Elimelech</hi> at the hand of <hi>Naomi.</hi> And for this reaſon in all ſuch ſales and paſſings away of Lands, from one to another, the inheritance in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiom</hi> was ſaid to <hi>riſe</hi> from the one to the other, as <hi>Gen. 23. 17, 18.

            <p>The reaſon why the Ancients were uſed to worſhip God with their Shoes off, was the ſame upon which all the Waſhings and Luſtrations either of the <hi>Levitical</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Worſhip depended, namely that it was the moſt cleanly and decent way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the divine preſence, the intention of Shoes or Sandals being nothing elſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe <hi>Warm</hi> and <hi>Eaſterly</hi> Climats, but only to defend thoſe that wore them from the ſoil and duſt of the way, when they walked abroad, or from the offenſive ſharpneſs of any ſtones or pebbles, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities that might annoy or hurt them in their paſſage, and therefore where the uſe of them, was not upon one of theſe two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of abſolute neceſſity, it was both more natural and more cleanly to go without them, &amp; was as well as many other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then made uſe of in religious Worſhip, a <hi>Symbolical</hi> repreſentation of that inward purity and innocence of mind, with which all men ought to approach the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and therefore it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From what hath been ſaid there, are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things very fit to be obſerved, and firſt I deſire that this agreement betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as to the ceremony and formality of their Feaſts, and indeed of all their Meals, may not be paſſed over without all manner of regard, becauſe in ſome ſhort notes, which I intend to add at the end of this diſcourſe, I ſhall give ſome other inſtances of a manifeſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch as cannot ſeem to have come by chance betwixt the two Nations, and becauſe in that other diſſertation which I have promiſed concerning the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> or rather <hi>

            <p>If it can be proved that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> both by their Language and their cuſtoms, are manifeſtly no other than a <hi>colony</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:98888:123"/> from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> if their firſt Lawgivers were either <hi>Jews</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> in that Latitude of the word in which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> takes it in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to the beſt Book that ever he writ, if their <hi>Prieſts</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Diis Syris.</note> and their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> both name and thing were moſt of them, as I ſhall prove they were, <hi>pure Hebrew;</hi> if after this it can be proved that the <hi>matrimonial prohibitions</hi> among the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> in all other inſtances were exactly the ſame, and if it can likewiſe be proved, as it ſhall beyond all poſſibility or colour of contradiction, that the <hi>Marriage of Couſin Germans,</hi> was abſolutely forbidden by the ancient Laws and uſages of <hi>Rome,</hi> then certainly all this if it will not ſerve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the ſame prohibition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it will add an invincible force and ſtrength to all thoſe arguments, which are a great many, by which the Unlawfulneſs of ſuch Marriages ſhall be proved either out of the Law it ſelf, or out of ſuch other Antiquity, as I ſhall undeniably demonſtrate, to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from it, and then I hope it will be<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 38.</note> granted that the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> it ſelf, which does expresſly proceed upon the <hi>Levitical</hi> meaſures, and does as plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all thoſe degrees to be Unlawful,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98888:123"/> which are included within the <hi>Moſaical</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, does by ſo doing condemn the Marriage of <hi>Couſin Germans</hi> as inceſtuous and Unlawful, which beſides the Natural and formal Unlawfulneſs of ſuch Marriages in themſelves,, which ſhall be abundantly manifeſted and made out, is all the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as to this point, which the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> themſelves can deſire.</p>
            <p>The Second thing to be obſerved, or rather again to be reflected upon and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd to the matter in queſtion, from what hath been diſcourſed above, is that the pulling off the Shoe or the ſtanding or ſitting barefoot in the Eaſtern Countries, was, as it is ſtill, a poſture of adoration or a poſture uſed in divine Worſhip; and I appeal to any man, let him be who he will that will but lay aſide prejudice, and give an equal Judgment between Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and me, whether this notion does not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconcile and explain the pretended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement betwixt the two writers of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> and remove all further occaſion or pretence of ſcruple, whether the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Ruth,</hi> were in conſequence and purſuance of that Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> by which the Brother was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to raiſe up Seed to the Brother.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:98888:124"/>
            <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, it is again to be taken notice, that neither of thoſe two places are a perfect and compleat account of the whole ceremony or formality of this matter, but that the defects of the one are to be ſupplyed out of the other, and if it be true what the Writer of the Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> does expresſly affirm, that <hi>this was the manner in former time in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things, a man plucked off his Shoe, and gave it to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and this was a teſtimony in</hi> Iſrael; then if the Marriage of the Brother to the Brothers Wife, were for the redemption of the Inheritance, as it is certain it was,<note place="margin">Hebr.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> if this were as real a <hi>changing,</hi> that is, as real a bargain or contract as any other; if it were done as publickly and ſolemnly in the face of the whole Congregation, as in this contract betwixt <hi>Ruth</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> which it is certain it was from <hi>Deut. 25. v.</hi> 8, 9, then it is plain that it required al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the uſual way of confirmation, which <hi>this Author</hi> tells us to have been the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>former times for a teſtimony in</hi> Iſrael, which is an undeniable and unanſwerable demonſtration of the agreement of this place of <hi>Ruth,</hi> with that of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:98888:124"/>
            <p>Again when the ſame Writer tells us that this was the practice in <hi>former time in</hi> Iſrael, this is a plain intimation that at that time when this Book was written it was diſuſed, and that this Book was at leaſt written ſome time before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> appears from the untainted <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm</hi> of its ſtile, which after that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to degenerate into <hi>Chalday,</hi> as appears by the Books of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> which were written in that period, and alſo from thoſe of <hi>Ezrah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> immediately after it.</p>
            <p>It is certain that at this day the <hi>Jews</hi> do not put in practice that their ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Brothers raiſing up Seed to the deceaſed Brother, nay, they expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it under pain of Excommunication, as <hi>P.

The general reaſon of my Judgment in this particular I have given already, becauſe that Book which appears to have been written before that Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, though we know not how long, ſpeaks of ſome part at leaſt of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony belonging to this Law or cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as already antiquated and out of uſe. <hi>This was the manner in former time,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in</hi> Iſrael; which is as much as to ſay, that then when this Book was written that cuſtom had expired.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:98888:125"/>
            <p>But if you will needs have a particular time aſſigned, when this practice began to be diſuſed, tho I am not obliged to give any more than a general proof that it was <hi>de facto</hi> ſo, that this uſage did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expire ſome time before the Captivity, yet that I may not ſeem to balk any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and that I may the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally demonſtrate the Ignorance of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and their adherents, which it is my deſign to expoſe, that no man may be deceived hereafter with hard names and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Roots, and that no mans pride, or vanity, or laborious folly may hereafter be miſcalled by the deſervedly venerable and ſacred name of Learning, I will therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a particular time when I believe this cuſtom to have ceaſed, and when I have given the reaſons of my opinion, I will then ſubmit it to the publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whether the <hi>Rabbins</hi> or I be in the right.</p>
            <p>The time which I ſhall pitch upon, ſhall be that of the diviſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> into two Kingdoms by the policy and ſeditious practices of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> at which time it is expresſly ſaid that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all the <hi>Levites</hi> out of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which there being forty <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 35.</note> Citys, four in each Tribe, theſe two
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98888:126"/> things do naturally and unavoidably follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Levites</hi> being driven out of all their Cities, belonging to the Ten Tribes, over which <hi>Jereboam</hi> ruled, it was impoſſible that the <hi>Levitical</hi> Cities which remained in the other Tribes of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> together with the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> which is to be taken into this account, ſhould hold them all, together with their Wives, Children, Servants, Goods and Cattel, wherefore it was neceſſary they ſhould be allow'd to ſhift for themſelves, and to ſettle up and down in common with the other <hi>Jews,</hi> living by their Labour, and enjoying Land of Inheritance, if by their induſtry they could get it, as well as others.</p>
            <p>And as their ſlocking in ſuch numbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Territory of the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> muſt needs make the alteration I have mentioned in thoſe places whether they repaired, ſo if you conſider the Cities which they left, together with the Suburbs or <hi>Pomaeria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, theſe Cities being all of them filled upon the baniſhment of the old Proprietors, by new Inhabitants, this makes a new and a very great alteration in the old partition or diſtribution of Lands which was ſetled by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:98888:126"/> at the firſt arrival of their Fathers out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay perhaps, that theſe Cities were beſtowed upon <hi>Jeroboam's new Prieſts,</hi> whom he ſet up in their ſtead, of the <hi>meaneſt</hi> of <hi>the people;</hi> to which it may be anſwered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this being only ſaid not proved a bare denyal is a ſufficient anſwer to a bare affirmation.</p>
            <p>2. Since <hi>Jeroboam</hi> eſtabliſhed not only a <hi>new Prieſt-hood</hi> but a <hi>new Worſhip</hi> too, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Golden Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> it is more likely that his <hi>new Prieſts</hi> and his <hi>new Altars</hi> went together, and that <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> were the only places, where this <hi>Lay Prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>Mongrel Clergy</hi> reſided.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The reaſon why this new eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment was made being expreſly aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1 <hi>Kings 12. 27. If this people go up to do Sacrifice in the Houſe of the Lord at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>then ſhall the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord, even unto</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam <hi>King of</hi> Judah. And then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>v. 28, 29. Whereupon the King took counſel and made two Calves of Gold, and ſaid unto them, it is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>Behold thy Gods, O</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and he ſet the one in</hi> Bethel <hi>and the other in</hi> Dan.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:98888:127"/>
            <p>Now the motive which induced him to make this alteration, being ſo expresſly ſet down viz. <hi>leſt the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord;</hi> and it being certain, which was the fundamental Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime upon which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> proceeded, that an union in the manners and cuſtoms of any nation with another, does alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an union of heart and mind into the bargain; and it being equally certain by experience that this is much more true in all kind of religious obſervances and rites, than in any other, that an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in divine Worſhip, does naturally produce a ſtrange and admirable ſympathy of will and affection in men to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the contrary to this, a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the outward modes and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Divine Service, if obſtinately adhered to and affectedly embraced and hugg'd by the ſeveral parties, produceth as ſtrange and unaccountable an enmity betwixt them; it was for the intereſt of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whoſe deſign was to make the hatred of the two people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> as mortal and inveterate as he could; it was but a conſequence of that fundamental reaſon upon which he proceeded, to alter the old eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> or <hi>Levitical</hi> Kingdom, as I may ſo call it,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98888:127"/> as much as ever he either could or durſt, that ſo the greatneſs of their diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to the cuſtoms or conſtitutions of this divided people, might produce the greater hatred and averſion in them both for one another; which was the very thing he intended, and which it was ſo highly and ſo manifeſtly his intereſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote by all the contrivances and all the ſtratagems that either wit or malice could deviſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It would be much more for the advantage of ſuch an uſurper to divide thoſe Cities among the common people, as a common prey, to unite them to one another, and to himſelf, and againſt his Enemies, by a common band of mutual and reciprocal intereſt among them all, which is found by experience to be the ſtrongeſt and the moſt laſting engagement of affection, than by ſetting up a new order of men that had no legal right to what they enjoyed, and ſeparating them after the <hi>Levitical</hi> manner from the reſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to raiſe the hatred and envy of the commonalty againſt them both, the King and his new Prieſts together.</p>
            <p>And as it has been the practice of this and other ages, as well as of that of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> to lay the foundation of civil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98888:128"/> in ſome either real or pretended ſcruples of Religion, ſo when thoſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had taken their effect, and had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the goodly frame of Government and the peaceable dependance of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of a wiſe and beautiful eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment upon each other, then to ſecure themſelves in that Dominion which they had Uſurped, it was the policy of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rebels to throw the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> Lands, as a ſpoil among the people, the better to engage them in <hi>intereſt</hi> to ſtand by their new Maſters, to which no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Duty</hi> could oblige them.</p>
            <p>But Fifthly, If he would not ſuffer the people to ſcramble for the ſpoil, yet ſtill there was a better way than to give it to the Prieſts, and that was to turn all theſe <hi>Levitical</hi> Cities, into ſo many Garriſon Towns, or Nurſeries for Souldiers, and military men to keep his Subjects in awe and ſerve him in his forreign Wars, and it is the more likely that he took this or ſome ſuch courſe; becauſe no Uſurpation can be long maintained without a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, whereas a rightful Authority is a thing to which all men have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, becauſe it is a part of that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and wholeſome juſtice by which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is ſecure in the enjoyment of his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98888:128"/> own, it is a thing againſt which no man can have a juſt pretence, and which none but neceſſitous or deſperate perſons, whoſe ruine is uſually owing to their vices, can have any real intereſt to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>Or Sixthly, If he did not take any of theſe courſes, yet he might have farmed out theſe <hi>Levitical</hi> Cities and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies at an eaſie and under rate, by which he would have been ſure to oblige many thouſands of his ſubjects, and would have filled his Coffers into the bargain, which would upon both accounts have been a very great and conſiderable acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſtrength and power to himſelf. They might have held their Lands by Knights Service, as hath been the practice former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>England,</hi> and as the <hi>Timariots</hi> in <hi>Turky</hi> do at this time.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In the 2 <hi>Chron. 13. 9. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bijah</hi> the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſon to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> in whoſe time the diviſion of the two Kingdoms happened, thus expoſtulates with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by whoſe <hi>faithleſs</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> practices that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was occaſioned. <hi>Have ye not caſt out the Prieſts of the Lord the Sons of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron, <hi>and the</hi> Levites, <hi>and have made you Prieſts after the manner of the nations of other Lands?</hi> In which words it is plain
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98888:129"/> not only that the <hi>Prieſts of the Lord the Sons of</hi> Aaron were caſt out, but that they are perfectly oppoſed to the <hi>Prieſts of</hi> Jeroboam, not only as a <hi>new</hi> Prieſthood, but as a Prieſthood after <hi>another manner;</hi> and what manner was that? why, it was <hi>the manner of the nations of other Lands,</hi> which could not be after the <hi>Levitical</hi> platform, becauſe the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſet apart from the reſt of the Tribes, and the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe perſons they did by this their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ſuſtain, were conſecrated and ſet apart from the reſt of their Families, for a particular reaſon in which the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no other nation under Heaven but themſelves, were concerned.</p>
            <p>But in the Eighth place, <hi>Abijah</hi> goes on, and does not only tell us in the words already produced, that the Prieſthood of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was after a <hi>diſtinct manner</hi> from that of the <hi>Levites,</hi> but in the very next words he immediately acquaints us <hi>what</hi> that manner was, <hi>ſo that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Whoſoever cometh to conſecrate himſelf with a Young Bullock and ſeven Rams, the ſame may be a Prieſt of them that are no Gods.</hi> It ſeems therefore that it was at every mans pleaſure to be a Prieſt or no Prieſt, as he pleaſed himſelf, a lively picture of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98888:129"/> our late confuſions, when the <hi>Sons of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron and the <hi>Levites</hi> were diſcarded, and inſtead of them Coblers and Weavers conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated themſelves to the Office of the Prieſthood, and it was a ſufficient call to the Miniſtry, for a Mechanick to be lazy or not to thrive upon his Handicraft Trade.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of which is, that there being no regular Prieſthood, but every man being a Prieſt or no Prieſt, as he pleaſed himſelf, there could be no regular maintenance neither. And indeed what can be more unreaſonable than to ſuppoſe, that there being ſuch a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſetled for the Prieſthood in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without regard to the perſons either as to their quality or number, as faſt as any man grew lazy, or diſcontented, or infirm and unfit for buſineſs, or opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of himſelf, and his qualifications for the Prieſthood, he ſhould be admitted not only into the number of the Prieſts, but at his own pleaſure inveſt himſelf in a right of feeding upon the ſacrifices and enjoying all the benefits and emoluments of the Prieſtly-Office; how muſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy needs ſwarm at this rate with a pack of lewd, ſcandalous, and lazy fellows, or who that had not a proſpect of very fair advantages, would be at any pains or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98888:130"/> to get his living, when ſuch encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements were propoſed to Idleneſs and Sloth? Or what maintenance indeed would be ſufficient, for ſuch an incredible ſwarm of ſluggards and ſlow Bellies, the Peſt and publick Nuſance of that miſerable ſtate, that is So unhappy as to give them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment? ſo that this it ſelf would have altered the <hi>Levitical</hi> conſtitution, without any more adoe, becauſe though the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Revenues and <hi>Demeſnes</hi> had been converted by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to the uſe of his new Prieſts, yet they would not have ſufficed; ſo that all things lying in this confuſion, and the regular conſtitution of the Prieſthood being deſtroyed, which is the only peaceable expedient in all nations to keep the people in Obedience, it was neceſſary, as hath been ſaid, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be governed by a <hi>ſtanding Army,</hi> this being the only way left, when the ſeveral parts of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not ſo regularly built, as to be able to ſupport themſelves, to preſerve the publick peace: And it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this was the very caſe, by the ſeveral changes that were made in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which did not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in the Family of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but ſuffered many alterations and remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98888:130"/> out of one Family into another, which is the uſual inconvenience of ſuch a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force, as may be ſeen ſufficiently in the Hiſtory of the late times; when the Army without any other warranty than that of the Sword, murthered Kings, diſſolved Parliaments, ſet up and depoſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours, as they called them, at their pleaſure. And beſides the late revolutions in the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Empire, and ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſtory, though a people that take a pride in being Slaves, and ſeem to be born for nothing ſo much as to obey, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, whether you conſider the horrid Butcheries of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Sulla,</hi> or after them of, <hi>Coeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> before the Empire began, or in the <hi>Monarchy</hi> it ſelf, the ſtory of <hi>Otho, Galba, Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> all of them Emperors, and the three firſt ſacrifices to their own ambition and to the power of their Enemies, within little more than the compaſs of one ſingle year. Or if you look ſtill lower into the Reigns and Deaths of thoſe Emperors that ſucceeded the firſt Twelve, you ſhall find almoſt all of them the creatures of military Tumult and Sedition, made what they were by the ſole Power and Authority of the Sword, and cloathed with the Robes of Majeſty
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98888:131"/> and all the habiliments of Imperial great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, only to adorn the tragical Scene of blood that was to follow, and to make them the more pompous and magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrifice to the luſt and ambition of thoſe that ſet them up.</p>
            <p>Which things, by the way, if the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters from our Church would ſeriouſly conſider, if they would reflect how impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is, but a toleration of every mans fancy and opinion in Religious Worſhip, and of his outward practice and behaviour in conſequence of that inward fancy and preconceived opinion, muſt of neceſſity produce a <hi>Babel</hi> of diſagreeing Sects and Parties which can no otherwiſe be kept in awe, but by a ſtanding Army. If they would remember the perpetual taxations &amp; arbitrary preſſures to which this way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment did ſo long expoſe either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their Fathers; if they would think a little with themſelves to what uncertainty and hazard, the eſtates, the perſons and the lives of men are expoſed by ſuch a military conſtitution, where Power, and not Juſtice, gives ſentence at the Bar, and executes that arbitrary ſentence at the Scaffold; if they would recollect a little with themſelves, that Bloody, rapacious, and arbitrary ſtory of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98888:131"/> the late Wicked and Rebellious times, which they will not endure to hear from others; if they could Summ up, what ſcarce any numbers are capable of reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the infinite bleſſings of ſecurity and peace, the infinite miſchiefs, cruelties, and devaſtations of War; If they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve over again within themſelves the fatal and frequent revolutions of the late giddy and ſlippery uſurpation, which not being ſupported, as it could not be, by a ſtable principle of Duty, and Religion, was toſſed to and fro, and ſtaggered like a drunken man with every new Wind of Ambition, Enthuſiaſm, or deſign, of private revenge or popular diſcontent; if they would but ſuffer themſelves to diſcern, what is very clear from the nature of the thing, which is the meaſure upon which wiſe men proceed, and from the experience of former times, which the <hi>proverb</hi> tells us is <hi>the Miſtreſs of Fools,</hi> that ſuch an unbounded liberty, as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick toleration of all parties and opinions amounts to, cannot otherwiſe be hindred from having all the ill effects of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual confuſion without a ſtanding force, to curb the inſolence of the contending parties, and hinder them from preying upon one another? If the ſame experience of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98888:132"/> our late troubles be ſufficient to inſtruct us that even this expedient will not do, but that the plague of diviſion and <hi>ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> animoſity will creep out of the City into the Camp, and will rage there ſo much the more ſtrongly as a malignant Feaver does in a robuſt and firm, than in a leſs maſculine or vigorous conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If they could but perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to believe, ſo eaſie a propoſition as this, that one good King, is better than Ten thouſand cruel, avaritious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Tyrants; that it is better to have liberty and peace for nothing than to pay Sixty or an Hundred Thouſand Pounds a Month for being ſlaves and vaſſals to the meaneſt of the people, the very offscow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and refuſe of mankind. Certainly who ever will give himſelf the leiſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe things, or will but have the patience to hear them, when they are told him by another, muſt unavoidably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that one of theſe four things are true; either peace and happineſs, are things perfectly unlawful in themſelves, and mankind is under a perfect obligation to be at perpetual ſtrife and variance with each other, which is not only a very ſtrange Doctrine, but I am confident in the midſt of all that infinite variety of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98888:132"/> opinions and factions, with which the laſt Age was infeſted, a very new one too; or elſe in the ſecond place he muſt be forced to ſay, that the terms of Unity that are eſtabliſhed by Law, are in themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be ſubmitted to: Or elſe thirdly that the uſe of the only lawful and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary means in order to a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful end, are in themſelves Unlawful; or elſe laſtly, he will find himſelf obliged to ſubmit to the preſent eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which by the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt of the diſſenters themſelves, enjoyes nothing at all but what would in it ſelf be Lawful if it were not impoſed: And if the impoſition makes it Unlawful, it is only for this reaſon becauſe peace and happineſs are ſo too, for ſo long as men are ſo ſubject as they are to fall out, about very ſmall matters; ſo long as there are and will always be, ſo many whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are tender to a diſeaſe, and ſo many that have no ſence of tenderneſs or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciance at all; ſo long as it is natural for the pretences of the one to become the ſcruples and grievances of the other, which they always will, wherever liberty and toleration is permitted; it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to keep the world, in any condition that hath the face of quietneſs or peace,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98888:133"/> without a publick rule of diſcipline and obedience which ſhall be the ſquare and meaſure of every mans external behaviour in Religious matters.</p>
            <p>But this is only by the by, for I do not deſign in this place to enter the liſts with any of our diſſenting Brethren, to whom ere it be long, I ſhall give another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, if they ſhall think it for the credit of their party or themſelves to embrace it, to ſtand up in defence of a no leſs fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh than wicked ſeparation; And ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſtory of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> which gave the occaſion to this ſhort excurſion, and I affirm that it would have been morally impoſſible ſo many revolutions, and changes ſhould have happened, as there did, in the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Kingdom, in ſo ſhort a time, which was transferred ſo frequently from one perſon and family to another, but by the means of a ſtanding Army, which though for the time it be the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of a great and uncontrouleable power, yet without a miracle of prudence in thoſe that are to govern, and of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and good temper in thoſe that are to obey, it cannot be the expedient of a ſafe and a laſting ſoveraignty over men.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed that God told <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98888:133"/> 1 <hi>KIngs 14. v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. For as much as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee Prince over my people</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>And rent the Kingdom away from the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and gave it thee, and yet thou haſt not been as my ſervant</hi> David, <hi>who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes, but haſt done evil above all that were before thee, for thou haſt gone and made thee other Gods, and molten Images to provoke me to anger, and haſt caſt me behind thy back: Therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will bring evil upon the houſe of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>and will cut off from</hi> Jeroboam <hi>him that piſſeth againſt the Wall, and him that is ſhut up and left in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and will take away the Remnant of the Houſe of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone; him that dyeth of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>in the City ſhall the Dogs eat, and him that dyeth in the Field ſhall the Fowls of the air eat, for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which place though I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but it is very clear, that the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Houſe was the effect of a ſupernatural Judgment, yet for all that it does not follow, and it appears<note place="margin">1 Kings 15. 29.</note>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98888:134"/> might be brought about, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and human means, and it being ſo neceſſary, as it hath been ſhewn it was, to <hi>Jeroboams</hi> circumſtances, that he ſhould govern by an Army, it is moſt likely that the ruine of his Family was effected, by the ambition or diſcontent of ſome who had conſiderable intereſt and power in the Souldiery, a ſort of military and therefore dangerous propularity, which is always juſtly ſuſpected and formidable to Princes. Neither can any good reaſon be given, why the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of them were as wicked and as Idolatrous as thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> continued all the while, till the time of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, in the line of <hi>David,</hi> while ſo many changes and revolutions happened in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that in the firſt, the Government was more civil or rather Eccleſiaſtical, whoſe parts were all regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly knit and faſtned to each other, but in the latter more turbulent, and military than the former, it being but natural for diſobliged, or neceſſitous or deſigning men with Swords in their hands, and a band of reſolute Partiſans at their heels, to carve out their own ſatisfaction, whenever they thirſt after greatneſs or revenge, and to endeavor the advancement of themſelves,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98888:134"/> though by all the foul Acts and miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious effects of Treaſon and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The firſt change or alteration that was made in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was in the time of <hi>Nadab</hi> the immediate Son of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 27. Baaſha <hi>the Son of</hi> Ahijah, <hi>of the Houſe of</hi> Iſſachar, <hi>conſpired againſt him</hi> (Nadab) <hi>and</hi> Baaſha <hi>ſmote him at</hi> Gibbethon, <hi>which belongeth to the</hi> Philiſtines, <hi>for</hi> Nadab <hi>and all</hi> Iſrael <hi>laid ſiege to</hi> Gibbethon. In which words as it is expresſly declared that <hi>Baaſha</hi> the Son of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> conſpired againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo nothing can be more plain, than that this was done by a <hi>motus caſtrenſis,</hi> it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy formed in the Leaguer, by the power and intereſt of <hi>Baaſha</hi> in the Army, as they lay entrenched before the walls of <hi>Gibbethon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Revolution that fell out after this, was in the time of <hi>Elah,</hi> the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Son and ſucceſſor of <hi>Baaſha,</hi> by the Treaſon of <hi>Zimri, 1 Kings 16. 9, 10. His Servant</hi> Zimri, <hi>Captain of half his Chariots, conſpired againſt him, as he was in</hi> Tirzah, <hi>drinking himſelf drunk in the Houſe of</hi> Arza, <hi>Steward of his Houſe in</hi> Tirzah, <hi>and</hi> Zimri <hi>went in and ſmote him, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, in the Twenty and Seventh year of</hi> Aſa <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>and Reigned in his ſtead.</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98888:135"/> Where, this Treaſon being effected by ſo great a commander, <hi>the Captain of half his Chariots,</hi> being done ſo publickly, as he was ſitting in the midſt of his Friends, and in the ſight of his very Guards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who it is very likely were of the confederacy with <hi>Zimri</hi> againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and <hi>Zimri</hi> being able not only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate ſo black a Treaſon, but alſo to place himſelf upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the room of him, whom he had with ſo much baſeneſs and perfidiouſneſs remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from it; all theſe things do ſufficiently ſhew, that it was not the wicked raſhneſs of one ſingle man, but it was a formed Confederacy in that part of the Army, that was at that time in and about <hi>Tirzah,</hi> being appointed, as it ſeems to me, for the guard of the Kings perſon, while the reſt of the people were ſtill encamped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gibbethon</hi> (a ſiege more tedious than that of <hi>Troy</hi> or <hi>Veii</hi>) which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they not ſiding with <hi>Zimri</hi> in his wickedneſs, but on the contrary, being deſperately incenſed againſt him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to revenge his perfidiouſneſs to the utmoſt, they immediately quitted the Blockade of <hi>Gibbethon,</hi> and came and ſat down before <hi>Tirzah,</hi> where <hi>Zimri</hi> and his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98888:135"/> party had enſconced and fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſiege was puſhed on with ſo much application and vigor, that they ſoon made themſelves Maſters of the place, for <hi>Zimri</hi> enjoyed his ill gotten dominion, no longer then <hi>Seven Days, 1 Kings</hi> 16. 15. and then ſaw himſelf reduced to that extremity, that there being no middle way, but either he muſt diſpatch himſelf, or fall into the hands of an enraged Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe inſolence and inhuman barbarity is uſually ſo great, that death is a kindneſs in compariſon of thoſe indignities, which the living ſuffer when fallen into ſuch cruel and unmerciful hands, he did as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man that had been worthy to Reign, had he not waded to the Throne through the Blood of him that ſat upon it, he choſe to die rather by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſame hand that had deſtroyed his Maſter, than ſuffer himſelf to be made a publick ſpectacle of infamy and diſgrace, an hiſſing and a laughing ſtock to Boys and Beggers. And therefore as the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators and other aged Perſons when the <hi>Gauls</hi> came in, and the Young men that were fit for ſervice, were all of them retired into the <hi>Capitol,</hi> ſat every man ready to receive the ſatal ſtroke, in his beſt attire, and in the Robes or Habiliments of thoſe honours
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98888:136"/> and offices which he had born in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſo they might periſh like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as became thoſe that had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like men, and underſtood how to die like ſuch; ſo here <hi>Zimri</hi> when he ſaw the City was taken, and that there was no hope left, that he might periſh like a King, <hi>he went into the Palace of the Kings Houſe and burnt the Kings Houſe over him with fire, and died.</hi> After the ſame manner that <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> did, who though his life have nothing in it, but what was ſoft and effeminate beyond expreſſion, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven to that hard <hi>dilemma</hi> either to die like a man or undergo the unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reproaches and indignities of a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and inveterat Rabble, the <hi>beaſts of the people,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls them, he made a wiſe choiſe of that extream, which was more ſuitable to the greatneſs of his Birth and Fortune, and expired in the midſt of his Palace and his Concubines, with all his luxury and all his vices flaming about his ears, ſo that though it cannot be deny'd that he lived like a <hi>fool,</hi> as every man does who gives himſelf up to that exceſs of delicacy and effeminate pleaſure, yet we may ſay of his death, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Abners, Died</hi> Sardanapalus, <hi>as a fool dieth?</hi> or was it not rather true, that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98888:136"/> 
               <hi>a Prince and a great man was fallen that day in</hi> Aſſyria?

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98888:138"/> the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and concerning the inſtance of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who was forſaken and abandoned, though, in the midſt of the utmoſt cruelties and provocations, never actually reſiſted and much leſs ſlain by his ſubjects; in which place I have likewiſe explained that whole Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> with all the certainty and unqueſtionable evidence even of direct and ſtrictly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical demonſtration, and to what I have ſaid there, I ſhall here only add that, nothing can juſtifie Rebellion againſt a Lawful Prince, but ſuch an expreſs War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Commiſſion as <hi>Jehu</hi> had, 2 <hi>Kings 9. v.</hi> 6, 7. where the Prophet <hi>poured Oyl upon his head, and ſaid unto him, thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I have Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee King over the People of the Lord, even over</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſmite the Houſe of</hi> Ahab <hi>thy Maſter.</hi> But I am very confident, if we have no Rebellion, till we have ſo plain a Warrant and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion too, we and our Children after us, may be very peaceable and quiet ſubjects for many, nay, for all ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zimri</hi> being thus diſpatched out of the way, the next that ſucceeded him in the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>Omri</hi> the <hi>Captain of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98888:139"/> the hoſt,</hi> whom the <hi>people</hi> made <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the <hi>Camp,</hi> and he, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed but he was a Lawful King, the Houſe of <hi>Baaſha</hi> being extinct, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 12. And <hi>Zimri</hi> not being a rightful Prince, but an Uſurping Traytor, <hi>v.</hi> 20. And therefore in this caſe it was Lawful for the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to chuſe them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be King over them; yet this is another inſtance of the Power of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery in depoſing of Princes, and in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them upon the Throne, and of the dangers and viciſſitudes to which any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is expoſed, when it is governed by the Sword, and is at the mercy of a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, in which every new ſedition and every freſh diſcontent endangers the continuance of the publick peace, and makes a proportionable revolution in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Omri</hi> enjoyed quietly as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which the Armies choice, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and his own merit and Loyalty, in revenging the death of his late Maſter <hi>Elah,</hi> had beſtowed upon him; but yet it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 26. that <hi>he walked in all the way of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat, <hi>and in his ſin wherewith he made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to anger with their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98888:139"/> vanities.</hi> However he Reigned quietly for the ſpace of <hi>Twelve Years, v.</hi> 23. and then <hi>he ſlept with his Fathers, v.</hi> 28. Which is as much as to ſay that he died in peace and by a natural death, <hi>and</hi> Ahab <hi>his Son</hi> Reigned in his ſtead, <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahab</hi> a very wicked and Idolatrous King, after having reigned for the ſpace of <hi>Twenty and Two Years,</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> in Battel againſt the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and was ſucceeded by <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his Son, whoſe Reign was very ſhort, for he Reigned but <hi>Two Years, 1 Kings</hi> 22. 51. and was ſucceeded by <hi>Jehoram,</hi> not his Son, for it is ſaid expresſly, that he had none, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 17, but his Brother, for <hi>Jehoram</hi> is expresſly called the Son of <hi>Ahab, 2. Kings</hi> 3. 1. and <hi>v.</hi> 2. it is ſaid, that <hi>he wrought evil in the ſight of the Lord, but not like his Father,</hi> (that is, <hi>Ahab) and like his Mother</hi> (that is, <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel) for he put away the Image of</hi> Baal <hi>that his Father had made,</hi> that is again, <hi>Ahab;</hi> for ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Ahab, 1 Kings 16. 31. that he went and ſerved</hi> Baal <hi>and Worſhipped him, and v. 32. He reared up an Altar for</hi> Baal <hi>in the Houſe of</hi> Baal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehoram</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Jehu</hi> the Son of <hi>Nimſhi,</hi> the <hi>Captain General</hi> of all <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horams</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:98888:140"/> forces, a man very famous for his exploits in War, and particularly for the boldneſs and fury of his attacks in Battel, who knowing very well, that expedition is the very life of buſineſs, when the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from <hi>Jehoram</hi> came one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ask him, <hi>is it peace?</hi> would not ſo much as ſtay to give them audience, but with a military roughneſs, <hi>what haſt thou</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to do with peace? turn thee behind me,</hi> and ſo drove on with all the ſpeed he could for <hi>Jezreel,</hi> where <hi>Joram</hi> lay to be healed of the Wounds, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a late Battel againſt <hi>Hazael</hi> King of <hi>Syria</hi> at <hi>Ramah;</hi> and the Watchman that ſtood upon an eminence to obſerve what became of the meſſengers that were ſent, knew that it was <hi>Jehu</hi> by the fury of his driving, though neither of the Meſſengers that were ſent returned; <hi>the driving</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is like the driving of</hi> Jehu, <hi>the Son of</hi> Nimſhi, <hi>for he driveth furiouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though it cannot be denyed that <hi>Jehu</hi> was in a moſt eſpecial manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God himſelf for the ſins of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Omri</hi> to be King, and was accordingly Anointed to the Kingly Office by the prophet, as hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſhewn, yet this divine deſignation
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98888:140"/> had its effect by natural and human means, by the power and intereſt of <hi>Jehu</hi> in the Army under his Command, as it was in the caſe of <hi>Omri,</hi> the head of that Royal family which was extinguiſhed in the perſon of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> and of his <hi>Seventy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> the Sons of <hi>Ahab 2 Kings c.</hi> 10. For ſo it is expresſly ſaid, when <hi>Jehu</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Captains of the Hoſt, with the ſubject of the Prophets meſſage to him 2 <hi>Kings 9. 12. Thus ſaith the Lord, I have Anointed thee King over</hi> Iſrael, that <hi>v. 13. they haſted and took every man his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and put it under him on the top of the Stairs, and blew with Trumpets ſaying,</hi> Jehu <hi>is King;</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi>'s party that had proclaimed him, was ſo ſtrong, that the rulers of <hi>Jezreel</hi> and the Elders that brought up <hi>Ahabs</hi> Children, being Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in number, <hi>c.</hi> 10. ſaw it was in vain to inſiſt upon their right, againſt ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a pretender to the Throne, <hi>v. 4. behold, two Kings ſtood not before him</hi> (that is, <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah, how then ſhall we ſtand?</hi> ſo that they were forced, though, as it ſeems, contrary to their Inclinations to comply with the Conqueror in a very cruel and ſanguinary Command, <hi>v. 6. take ye the heads of the men, year Maſters Sons, and come to me to</hi> Jezreel <hi>by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98888:141"/> to morrow this time,</hi> and accordingly <hi>it came to paſs, v. 7. when</hi> Jehu'<hi>s letter came to them, that they took the Kings Sons</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſeventy perſons</hi> which were with the <hi>great men</hi> of the City, that brought them up, <hi>v. 6.) and put their heads in Baskets and ſent them to</hi> Jezreel, <hi>and as he had ſerved his Sons, ſo he ſerved likewiſe, all that remained of the Houſe of</hi> Ahab <hi>in</hi> Jezreel, <hi>and all his great Men and his Kinsfolks, and his Prieſts, until he left him none remaining. v.</hi> 11. So that this is another inſtance of military revolutions, and of the miſchiefs and calamities, to which that nation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, where Armies are in conſtant pay, and are either divided among themſelves, in the conſequences of which diviſion the State cannot be unconcerned, or acted una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly by their own diſcontents, or by the deſigns, the ambitions, or the private and concealed reſentments of their leaders, or when being at leiſure from any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſervice they are at leiſure likewiſe to do the more miſchief at home, as it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, impoſſible ſo great a body of men, made up for the moſt part, as it is in all the world beſides, of a mixt multitude of Knaves and Fools, ſhould not brew ſome miſchief, when they are out of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Commanders have little elſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98888:141"/> to do but to lay out a Scheme of greatneſs for themſelves, and then purſue the means of compaſſing their deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehu</hi> Reigned <hi>Twenty and Eight Years,</hi> and at length died in peace, and <hi>ſlept with his Fathers, and</hi> Jehoahaz <hi>his Son Reigned in his ſtead, 2 Kings</hi> 10. 35, 36. And in the line of <hi>Jehu</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, during the Reigns of the four Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſucceeding Princes, that is to ſay, <hi>Jehoahaz, Jehoaſh, Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond of that name, and <hi>Zachariah,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Shallum</hi> the Son of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> conſpired, <hi>c.</hi> 15. 10. and that it was by a publick and formed conſpiracy, as well as any of thoſe other changes in the Crown of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which have been mentioned, appears by this, that it is ſaid, that <hi>he ſmote him before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and that <hi>he Reigned in his ſtead.</hi> The firſt of which he would not have dared to do, and the laſt he could not poſſibly have effected, had he not had before hand a conſiderable power and intereſt in the people before whom he is ſaid to have ſlain <hi>Zachariah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſee the inconſtancy of diſloyal Subjects, who have once forfeited their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to their Lawful Prince, they can be true to no Intereſt, no Perſon, or Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhment (as it proved by our own experience
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98888:142"/> in the late giddy times,) when once they have proſtituted that incommunicable fidelity, which is wholly and entirely due to the rightful and Lawful King and to none elſe beſides him, for <hi>Shallum</hi> Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but <hi>One</hi> ſingle <hi>Mouth</hi> and then gave place to Fate and to the more powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Menahem</hi> the Son of <hi>Gadi,</hi> who <hi>went up from</hi> Tirzah, <hi>and came to</hi> Samaria, <hi>and ſmote</hi> Shallum <hi>the Son of</hi> Jabeſh <hi>in</hi> Samaria, <hi>and ſlew him and Reigned in his ſtead, 2 Kings</hi> 15. 14. And with what cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he mannaged that power which he had gotten, and the conqueſt which he and his party had made over <hi>Shallum</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, appears immediately in the next words, and is a woful example as well as the ſtory of <hi>Jehu,</hi> of thoſe unſpeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and devaſtations, with which all publick revolutions are generally attended, <hi>v. 16. he ſmote</hi> Tiphſah <hi>and all that were therein, and the coaſts thereof from</hi> Tirzah: <hi>becauſe they opened not to him therefore he ſmote it,</hi> and (as if <hi>Tipſah</hi> and <hi>Tredagh</hi> had been the ſame) he put all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and the Gariſon to the Sword, <hi>And all the Women therein, that were with Child he ript up;</hi> and the cauſe of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty being expreſſed, <hi>becauſe they opened not unto him,</hi> this ſhews what diviſions
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98888:142"/> and animoſities there were at that time in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſome taking part with <hi>Menahem,</hi> and ſome with <hi>Shallum,</hi> which factions were ſo great and boyſterous among them, that they could not be appeaſed with the death of one of the contending parties but prevailed ſo far, that <hi>Pul</hi> King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> made uſe of this advantage and <hi>came againſt the Land,</hi> weakened and divided by its own inteſtine broils, which were ſo great and dangerous, that <hi>Menahem</hi> found himſelf obliged to make his peace upon the beſt terms he could with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, therefore <hi>he gave him a Thouſand Talents of Silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the Kingdom in his hand,</hi> which was the cauſe of grievous taxations, and arbitrary fines levied upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without any regard to Equity or Juſtice, to the ruine and impoveriſhment even of the <hi>mighty men of Wealth,</hi> who it ſeems, as they had reaſon, were very loath to part with their mony, but it was too late to diſpute the power of two Kings together, and one of them ſo potent, that he could force an obedience, if the thing it ſelf were but poſſible, to whatſoever he Commanded <hi>v. 20. And</hi> Menahem <hi>exacted the mony of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>even of all the mighty men of Wealth, each man Fifty Shekels of Silver, to give to the King of</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:98888:143"/> Aſſyria: <hi>So the King of</hi> Aſſyria (well pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his journey) <hi>turned back and ſtayed not there in the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menahem</hi> Reigned Ten Years and <hi>ſlept with his Fathers and</hi> Pekahiah <hi>his Son Reigned in his ſtead;</hi> but his Reign was but very ſhort, he Reigned but Two Years, and then Pekah <hi>the Son of</hi> Remaliah, <hi>one of the Captains of his hoſt conſpired againſt him, and ſmote him in</hi> Samaria, <hi>in the Palace of the Kings Houſe, with</hi> Argob, <hi>and</hi> Arieh, <hi>and with him Fifty men of the</hi> Gileadites, <hi>and he killed him and Reigned in his Room, 2 Kings</hi> 15. 25. And in his days, there being, as it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, great diviſions among the People of <hi>Iſrael, Tiglath Pileſer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> layed hold on the occaſion, and <hi>took</hi> Ijon <hi>and</hi> Abel-beth-maachah, <hi>and</hi> Janoah, <hi>and</hi> Kedeſh, <hi>and</hi> Hazor, <hi>and</hi> Gilead, <hi>and</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, <hi>all the land of</hi> Naphtali, <hi>and carried them Captive to</hi> Aſſyria. Neither was this all, but <hi>Hoſhea</hi> the Son of <hi>Elah</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe took the opportunity of thoſe factions which he found among the people to ſet up for himſelf, therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 30. he <hi>made a conſpiracy againſt</hi> Pekah <hi>the Son of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliah, <hi>and ſmote him and ſlew him and Reigned in his ſtead, in the Twentieth year of</hi> Jotham <hi>the Son of</hi> Uzziah. Laſtly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98888:143"/> 
               <hi>Hoſhea</hi> Reigned in <hi>Samaria</hi> Nine Years, and then the great and final Captivity of <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneſer</hi> happened, which put a fatal peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it was diſtinguiſhed from that of <hi>Judah, 2 Kings c.</hi> 17. and thus it was exactly true of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who very few of them died a natural death.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ad generum Cereris ſine caede &amp; ſanguine pauci</l>
               <l>Deſcedunt reges, &amp; ſiccâ morte Tyranni.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Having thus given a particular account of the ſtate of affairs in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the time of its diviſion, from <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> till the Captivity of <hi>Shalmaneſer,</hi> in which the very name and memory of the Ten Tribes was loſt, I could now make a no leſs pleaſant, than profitable repreſentation of the ſtate of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> likewiſe, if it would not be a digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but I have done all that I deſigned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which was only to ſhew that the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the diviſion of the two Kingdoms from one another, was governed altogether by the power of the Sword, and that the factions prevailing from time to time in the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Armies, and the power and intereſt of this or that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98888:144"/> Commander among the Souldiers, were the true cauſes of thoſe many and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions which happened among them, and of the ſupreme powers being ſo frequently tranſlated out of one Family into another, and that from hence it may ſeem probable that there being Armies in continual pay, and the <hi>Levitical</hi> Cities being emptyed of their old Inhabitants, that they were diſtributed among the Souldiers, as well for the ſatisfaction of their arrears, as that the Souldiery by this means being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might be the more ſerviceable to keep the people in obedience, and might be ready at hand in what quarter ſoever any popular tumult or inſurrection ſhould happen. But I am not at all ſollicitous, whether this be ſo or no, only if it be ſo, it will ſerve my turn, to prove that the old partition of inheritances was at this time deſtroyed, and if it be not ſo, yet it is certain that the <hi>Levites</hi> were expelled, and we may be equally confident that theſe Cities were filled with new inhabitants, it being the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of folly and dotage to imagine, that they were ſuffered to lie Idle and Uſeleſs, without any new inhabitants at all; and this it ſelf will as effectually deſtroy the old partition as the other way.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:98888:144"/>
            <p>Another argument by which it will undeniably appear that the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was by no means after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood,</hi> may be drawn from the expreſs words of <hi>Abijah,</hi> immediately ſubjoyned to thoſe other words of his which I have laſt produced by which the manners and cuſtoms of the one are expresſly diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to the manners, rites and uſages of the other, 2 <hi>Chron. 13. v. 10, 11. But as for us the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him, and the Prieſts, which miniſter unto the Lord are the Sons of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on, <hi>and the</hi> Levites <hi>wait upon their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and they burn unto the Lord, every Morning and every Evening, burnt Sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſweet incenſe; the Shew-bread alſo ſet they in order upon the pure table, and the Candleſtick of Gold with the Lamps thereof, to burn every Evening; for we keep the charge of the Lord our God, but ye have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoken him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A tenth conſideration by which it may appear that the Prieſthood of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was not after the <hi>Levitical</hi> manner, and that they were not placed by him in the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Cities, which the <hi>Levites</hi> themſelves had been compelled to relinquiſh, may be drawn from thoſe words of <hi>Abijah</hi> which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98888:145"/> have been already inſiſted upon, though not to the ſame purpoſe for which I now produce them, 2 <hi>Chron. 13. 9. So that whoſoever cometh to conſecrate himſelf with a Younog Bullock and Seven Rams, the ſame may be a Prieſt of them that are no Gods.</hi> From, which words it is plain that <hi>Jeroboams Prieſts</hi> were Prieſts <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſo called; they all of them did ſacrifice, and ſprinkled the blood by way of expiation for themſelves as well as for others, otherwiſe they did not <hi>conſecrate themſelves,</hi> as it is here expresſly ſaid they did, but they were conſecrated to the Prieſtly office, by thoſe to whom the performance of this ſacrifice in their behalf appertained; now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this part of the Prieſthood, which conſiſted in ſprinkling of the blood and making an atonement for the Souls either of themſelves or others, belonged only to the Prieſts <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſo called, this being the moſt <hi>ſacred</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> Character of the Prieſthood, and therefore was not common to all the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were diſperſed through the whole Land, and had in a <hi>greater latitude</hi> the <hi>charge</hi> of the <hi>holy things,</hi> but was peculiar to the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who had always their conſtant reſidence at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were bound to give their daily attendance upon the Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:98888:145"/> ſo that the Prieſthood of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> being not barely a <hi>Levitical,</hi> but a more <hi>ſtrict,</hi> and <hi>ſacrificial</hi> Prieſthood, ſuch as was peculiar to the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the only places of Sacrifice ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> being the two Altars erected at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> it follows plainly from the nature of his Prieſthood, compared with the places where it could only be exerciſed, that theſe two were the only places where his Prieſts reſided:</p>
            <p>An Eleventh conſideration by which the diſtinction of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Prieſthood from that of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> will appear, may be taken from the different ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their reſpective conſecration to the Prieſtly Office, as it is deſcribed <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. in the words of <hi>Abijah</hi> ſo often appealed to.</p>
            <p>A Twelfth argument ſhall be taken from the <hi>difference</hi> of the <hi>Feaſts,</hi> which were obſerved by the one Prieſthood and the other, for <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to make the greater diſtinction and the wider breach between the two nations of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> had altered the time of the ſolemn Feaſts, that the people might not be tempted to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and do ſacrifice, at the ſame ſolemn and ſtated times when thoſe of

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98888:146"/> againſt <hi>Joſeph Scaliger.</hi> Now <hi>Seven</hi> and <hi>Eight,</hi> in theſe caſes are the ſame, as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath obſerved before me, and therefore <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſaith of the Paſſover, ſomtimes that it was a Feaſt of <hi>Seven,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Eight</hi> Days continuance; in the firſt account ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that day in which the Paſſover was killed, which did not belong to the Feaſt of the Paſſover <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, and in the latter including it: And ſo here, if you take in the <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> which is the Month before <hi>Niſan,</hi> then <hi>Tiſri</hi> is the <hi>Eighth</hi> Month, but if you conſider the Months only <hi>incluſivè,</hi> beginning at <hi>Niſan</hi> or <hi>Abib,</hi> then it is the <hi>Seventh,</hi> which is a plain way of reconciling this ſeeming diſagreement betwixt <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the <hi>writer</hi> of the Book of Kings. And to ſhew ſtill more plainly that both writers are to be underſtood of the ſame Feaſts, it is to be conſidered that the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Religion from the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Prieſts, which were ſent among them to inſtruct them, as appears by the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Second</hi> Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> where the ſtory of <hi>Salmaneſers</hi> deportation is related, and theſe Prieſts were ſubjects of that Kingdom and Prieſts of that Order and Inſtitution of which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was the Founder; ſo that I think there can be no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98888:147"/> doubt, that the ſame Feaſt is underſtood by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> with that which is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> but <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Feaſt is expreſly ſaid to have been the Paſſover, therefore it follows that in the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> we are alſo to expound and interpret it of the ſame; and as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> explains the ſacred ſtory, ſo on the other hand the <hi>inſpired Writer</hi> returns <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his kindneſs back again, by giving authority and credit to his relation: And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not underſtand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which it is eaſie to prove that he did not, and I think I have done it in ſome other papers, the name it ſelf does ſufficiently vouch the credibility of the ſtory, ſince its ſignification is ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the practice of the ſect it ſelf which he deſcribes. I do therefore diſown and recant thoſe reaſons, which I have given of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> practice, as to this particular, in the papers I have mentioned, which being already finiſhed from the preſs, though not yet publiſhed, cannot be recalled; ſince it appears ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is wholly owing to the perverſe inſtitution of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> which was deviſed by him on ſet purpoſe, to make the breach wider, and the enmity more irreconcileable betwixt the two Kingdoms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98888:147"/> 
               <hi>Judah.</hi> And it is further to be noted that he did not only inſtitute a new Feaſt, or which is the ſame thing, an old Feaſt at a new time, but alſo that he did ſacrifice in his own perſon, by that means invading the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, a ſin ſo grievous in the ſight of God, that for this very thing, for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice of himſelf, before <hi>Samuel</hi> came into the camp, the Kingdom was rent from <hi>Saul</hi> and his poſterity, and <hi>Azariah</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> only for <hi>burning Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe,</hi> though in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a very good, and a very pious King, was ſmitten with the Leproſie all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after.</p>
            <p>But in the thirteenth and laſt place, it appears beyond all poſſibility, all colour of contradiction, that the Prieſts of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> were not diſperſed in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Cities, all over the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as the <hi>Levites</hi> themſelves were, but only in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> from the expreſs words of the text it ſelf, 1 <hi>Kings 12. 32. And he placed in</hi> Bethel <hi>the Prieſts of the high places which he had made;</hi> and there being the ſame ſacredneſs of <hi>Dan</hi> as of <hi>Bethel,</hi> the ſame kind of Prieſts belonging to them both, and the ſame ſacrifices and ceremonies to be performed at both places, there is no queſtion but it is to be underſtood <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:98888:148"/> of them both, that <hi>Dan</hi> as well as <hi>Bethel</hi> was to be the reſidence and habitation of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts. <hi>Quod erat oſtendendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though theſe reaſons are ſufficient to prevail with me to retract that opinion which I have elſewhere favoured, though I could not poſitively affirm it, that the <hi>Levitical</hi> Revenues and Demeſnes were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and conferred by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> upon his new Prieſts; yet as to the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, concerning the time when the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> partition ceaſed, and the ancient boundaries of Inheritances were confuſed, it is all one to me whether it be true or no, becauſe it is certain upon the baniſhment of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that theſe Cities were filled again by new Inhabitants of one ſort or other, which is ſufficient of it ſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the old partition of the Tribes, when it appears ſo plainly that one Tribe was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally expelled from their ancient ſeats, and that into the places, which were by their departure left empty, there were other Tribes and Families, that had formerly no claim or pretence to Inhabit there, admitted. But this is not all neither, there is another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration yet behind, which will of it ſelf demonſtrate all that I deſign to prove, and that is, that the <hi>Moſaical</hi> partition ceaſed,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98888:148"/> at the time of the diviſion of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My argument is taken from thoſe words of 2 <hi>Chron. 11. 13, 16, 17. And the Prieſts and the</hi> Levites <hi>that were in all</hi> Iſrael <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him out of all their coaſts.—And after them out of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſeek the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>came to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to ſacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord God of their Fathers, ſo they ſtrengthened the Kingdom of</hi> Judah <hi>and made</hi> Rehoboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Solomon <hi>ſtrong.</hi> So that here being, beſides the <hi>Levites,</hi> being one whole Tribe, ſo great a party flocking to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of all the reſt of the Tribes, as to be ſo great an acceſſion of ſtrength and power to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> theſe following things muſt unavoidably come to paſs: Firſt that ſo many new Families being crouded in ſo ſmall a compaſs, that the natural growth and product of the Country ſeems to have been very far from being of it ſelf ſufficient to maintain them, they found themſelves obliged to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to commerce and traffick with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour nations, and to improve their ſtocks by trade; and it being utterly impoſſible that the trade of a nation ſhould be managed without taking mony up at intereſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs people would be ſo good natured as to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98888:149"/> lend it for nothing, which is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: And again, it being equally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that Uſury ſhould be practiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deſtruction of that <hi>Moſaical</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Inheritances, for the preſervation of which the Prohibition of Uſury was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a Law, as I have ſhown more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Couſin Germans,</hi> it is a plain caſe, that the old Diſtribution of Inheritances, which was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> muſt at this time begin to be confounded; and the ſame Cauſes that firſt made the breach upon the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Platform, would ſoon reduce it into ſuch abſolute Confuſion, that the old Partition of the Tribes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as to the Lands or Meſſuages belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, would be perfectly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And this Argument would be yet more ſtrong, if it were true what is ſaid, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 20. That <hi>there were none that followed the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>but the tribe of</hi> Judah <hi>only;</hi> which ſeems to have been done in conſequence of what God himſelf had ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> c. 11. 13. <hi>Howbeit, I will not rend away all the Kingdom: but will give one Tribe to thy Son, for</hi> David <hi>my Servant ſake, and for</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>ſake, which I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:98888:149"/>
            <p>But theſe things are not by any means to be underſtood in the utmoſt Strictneſs and Propriety of Acceptation; for it is indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably certain, That that one Tribe was two and a half: and ſo <hi>v.</hi> 30. of this Eleventh Chapter, <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet catches hold on the new Garment that was on <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and rends it into twelve pieces, which twelve pieces were intended <hi>Symbollically</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and <hi>v. 31. He ſaid to</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>Take thee ten pieces: for thus ſaith the Lord, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Behold, I will rend the Kingdom out of the Hand of</hi> Solomon, <hi>and will give Ten Tribes to thee.</hi> From whence it follows plainly, that there muſt be two remaining to the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> and yet it follows, <hi>v. 32. But he ſhall have one Tribe for my ſervant</hi> Davids <hi>ſake, and for</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>ſake, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I have choſen out of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. And again, <hi>v. 36. And unto his Son will I give one Tribe;</hi> but it is clear, That that one Tribe was two; for it is ſaid expreſly, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 21. that <hi>when</hi> Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam <hi>was come to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>he aſſembled all the Houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>with the Tribe of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>an hundred and fourſcore thouſand choſen men, which were Warriours, to fight againſt the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to bring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom again to</hi> Rehoboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Solomon.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98888:150"/> And <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> is likewiſe taken into the Account. <hi>The word of God came unto</hi> Shemajah <hi>the man of God, ſaying, Speak unto</hi> Rehoboam <hi>the Son of</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>and unto all the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>and to the Remnant of the people, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. Where it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that by the <hi>Remnant of the people,</hi> which is here plainly diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Two Tribes</hi> of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> nothing elſe but the <hi>half Tribe</hi> of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. And the true reaſon why <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> ſided with <hi>Judah</hi> in this Conjuncture, bating the Buſineſs of Religion, which might be a Motive to them, as well as it was to ſeveral of the other Tribes to come and aſſociate themſelves with them, ſeems to have been this; That <hi>Benjamin</hi> it ſelf was a Pretender to a Soveraignty over the reſt of the Tribes, in right of <hi>Saul</hi> the Son of <hi>Kiſh,</hi> who was the firſt King both of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together, which was the reaſon of <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Sheba</hi> the Son of <hi>Bichri</hi>'s Rebellion againſt him, both of them being <hi>Benjamites,</hi> and one <hi>of the Family of the Houſe of</hi> Saul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Enemies to the Family of <hi>David,</hi> and the Royal Houſe of <hi>Judah;</hi> but when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> an <hi>Ephrathite,</hi> ſet up for himſelf, they not being ſtrong enough to make a diſtinct
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98888:150"/> Kingdom by themſelves, choſe rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederate with the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> who had been choſen King, by God himſelf, and who was ally'd by Marriage to the Houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> than to favour the Pretences of an Upſtart of the Houſe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which had never any juſt pretence or title to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon which may be aſſigned of theſe Two Tribes and an half confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating together, is the convenience of their ſituation, being all of them the very next Neighbours to each other; for it is ſaid, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 11. That <hi>the lot of the Tribe of the Children of</hi> Benjamin <hi>came up according to their Families, and the coaſt of their Lot came forth between the Children of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Joſeph. From whence it is manifeſt, that the Inheritances of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> did border and abutt upon each other; and the Children of <hi>Joſeph</hi> being divided into the Two Tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in this place, we are not to underſtand the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of which Tribe <hi>Jeroboam</hi> himſelf was, and therefore that whole Tribe ſided with him, but of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> which was divided into Two; the one half on the one ſide of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> being a part of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:98888:151"/> and belonged to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> as well for the conveniance of its Situation, as upon any other Account; and the other half was on the other ſide of the River, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Sons of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Reuben,</hi> and belonged to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, a third Reaſon which may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, why theſe Two Tribes and an half <hi>aſſociated</hi> themſelves together, or rather, kept ſtedfaſt in their Allegiance to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, beſides the Duty, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Loyalty and Integrity conſidered in themſelves, may be fetched farther off from the Kindneſs and good Will of the Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Patriarchs of theſe Tribes to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for <hi>Judah</hi> ſaved <hi>Joſeph</hi> from being ſlain by his Brethren, and by conſequence was a kind of Father to the Two Tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who, without this, had periſhed before they were born; and it is well known what Kindneſs there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> both of them the Sons of <hi>Rachel,</hi> the beloved Wife of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and one of them the Fruit of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers old Age, the Stay and Support of his declining years, after the loſs of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whom he gave over for dead, and the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Progenitor of ſo numerous a Tribe. But whether the King of <hi>Judah</hi> were only
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98888:151"/> poſſeſſed of that one Tribe, which gave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to his Kingdom; or whether he were alſo, as I have proved he was, King over <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and the Remnant of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> likewiſe; yet it is certain, when we have taken things in the utmoſt Latitude that the Truth will bear, that after all, by the flocking of the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Territory of <hi>Judah,</hi> and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſo many others out of all the reſt of the Tribes, it muſt of neceſſity come to paſs, That the old Partition of Inheritances muſt be deſtroyed, and that the Land being too little to afford them all a ſedentary Subſiſtence at home, they muſt be forced to take up Money at uſe, to be employed in a foreign Trade, which was forbidden only to preſerve the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſtribution, and which being once allowed, I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated<note place="margin">Diſcourſe of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>As to the firſt of theſe <hi>Dr. Cudworth</hi> hath<note place="margin">p. 35. ubi ſupra.</note> theſe words: <hi>There is an excellent ſtory in</hi> Maimonides <hi>his</hi> Moreh Nevochim, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an ancient cuſtom of the</hi> Zabii, <hi>of Feaſting together with their Gods in a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral way—For going about to give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the eating of Blood was forbidden in the Law, he fetches it from the Idolatrous uſe of it then in</hi> Moſes'<hi>s time among the</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii; <hi>according to his principles, who thought the reaſon of all the Ceremonial Precepts was to be fetched from ſuch accidental grounds, becauſe thoſe Laws were not</hi> primae, <hi>but</hi> ſecundae intentionis, <hi>in God,</hi> Multarum legum rationes &amp; cauſae, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> mihi inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerunt ex cognitione fidei, rituum &amp; cultûs
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98888:155"/> Zabiorum. Very like; but I long extremely to hear this <hi>excellent</hi> ſtory, and therefore enter <hi>Aben Tibbon</hi> Druggerman in chief to the great <hi>R. Moſes Ben Maimon;</hi> and what ſayes he? why, he tells us, as he had it from <hi>Maimonides</hi> his own mouth, upon the faith of a <hi>Rabbin,</hi> and by all that is ſacred in that <hi>Whisker</hi> of a Book the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud. Quòd licet ſanguis impurus &amp; immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus admodum fuerit in oculis</hi> Zabiorum; <hi>tamen ab illis comeſtus fuerit, eò quod ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtimarunt cibum hunc eſſe Demonum, &amp; quod is qui eum comedit, hac ratione com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationem aliquam cum Demonibus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat, it à ut familiariter cùm illo converſentur, &amp; futura ei aperiant.</hi> An excellent ſtory indeed! and every whit as good ſenſe as the <hi>plaſtick nature,</hi> and other <hi>pretty tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gams</hi> in the <hi>Intellectual ſyſteme;</hi> but if no body be a <hi>Biſhop</hi> till this <hi>excellent ſtory</hi> be true, the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> ſucceſſion from this time forward will fail.</p>
            <p>But ſay you ſo Maſter <hi>Tibbon?</hi> and are you ſure you had this from <hi>Maimonides</hi> himſelf? <hi>Dah chi hadam hou Tamè mod,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Know that the Blood was accounted very impure in the Eyes of the</hi> Zabians, <hi>and yet they were uſed to eat it,</hi> &amp;c. This may be <hi>excellent</hi> for ought any body knows, becauſe it is very ſtrange and this is the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98888:156"/> common Priviledge of all ſtrange things, that people are uſually very civil to Strangers, and therefore they paſs for <hi>excellent</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Examination: Otherwiſe if a man were minded to be ſo barbarouſly rude, to call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in queſtion, which is affirmed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be true or falſe, <hi>fide Rabbinicâ,</hi> upon the skill or honeſty of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctor, he might argue thus:</p>
            <p>All things that were anciently looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as impure, were ſo upon one or both of theſe accounts; either they were impure in Sacrifice or Food, or both; or by impure was meant, That it was not lawful to touch, or have any thing to do with them; now if the Blood were impure, that is, unlawful to be eaten; and if the <hi>Zabians</hi> thought ſo, why did they eat it in Contradiction to themſelves, and in defiance to their own Conſciences and Underſtandings? Again, though they had an Opinion that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, yet they offered it up in Sacrifice to their Idols, that is, they uſed it by way of Expiation, as the words of <hi>Tibbon</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do very plainly aknowledg. And this indeed, was no wonder, for by Expiating and Atoning for the Souls of men, it came to be impure, as being polluted with the ſins of thoſe, in whoſe behalf it was ſhed; which by the way ſufficiently diſcovers the Error
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98888:156"/> and Unskilfulneſs of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to drink the very Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament, which, as being the Blood of an Expiatory Sacrifice, is for that reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be drunk or eaten; and it was for that reaſon, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, That he ſuffered without the Gate, as the Sin-offering was uſed to do without the Camp, becauſe he had contracted a <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Uncleanneſs, as the Sin-offering did, by being polluted with the ſins of thoſe in whoſe behalf he was offered.</p>
            <p>But then if you conſider what hath been already proved, That every Meal among the Ancients, as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Heathens,</hi> had the nature of a Sacrifice; it follows plainly, that the Blood of all Animals was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unclean, as being always of an expiatory Nature. And therefore if the <hi>Zabians</hi> drank the Blood of any Sacrifice, they might as well drink it at all their Meals; and to ſay, they did at ſometimes, but not at others, is to ſay, That they did that ſometimes, and which is worſe upon a Religious Account too, which they knew was always unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, and which indeed was the higheſt Profanation of that <hi>Victimary</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in which all the Religion of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient World conſiſted.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:98888:157"/>
            <p>But whether it be owing to the Evidence of Truth, or the Inconſiſtency of the former Tale to it ſelf, or to ſpin out his time in a multitude of words, or for what other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I know not; but he tells us afterwards, That there was a Faction among the <hi>Zabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> themſelves, and that there were ſome that made a great ſcruple of this Eating of Blood, and therefore <hi>performed their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
               <note place="margin">True no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>in a little different manner,</hi> which is there deſcribed, eating the fleſh themſelves, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do in their Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and in all their Meals, which were, though not ſo ſolemn, of the ſame Nature; and feeding the <hi>Daemon</hi> with the Blood, that is, pouring it out upon his Altar by way of Expiation, as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were wont to do by the expreſs Command of God himſelf, differing only from the <hi>Zabians</hi> of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> whom he endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and whom he would make in every thing ſo oppoſite to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of this Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the Argument which is there brought as the reaſon upon which this other pretended Faction of the <hi>Zabii</hi> proceeded, is of it ſelf abundantly ſufficient to confute the whole Story: <hi>Vehajou ſham anaſhim ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hajah kaſhah beheneihem achilath hadam, chi hou dabar ſhejimaſhou tebah haadam.</hi> 
               <q>There
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98888:157"/> were ſome among them, to whom the eating of Blood ſeemed hard in their Eyes, becauſe it is a thing which the Nature of man abhors;</q> and this a man would think might be enough to perſwade us, that it was never the conſtant uſe of the Sacrifices of any Nation, that is, in effect of all their Meals which had all of them the Nature of a Sacrifice, as hath been already frequently declared.</p>
            <p>But the learned Doctor goes on; and <hi>as for the former part of this Story,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I find it alſo in</hi> R. Moſes Bar Nachman <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Deut. 12. 23. <hi>where he goes about to give the reaſon why Blood was forbidden in the Law, as</hi> Maimonides <hi>did; although in the firſt place,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it was becauſe Blood ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Sacrifices for expiation, otherwiſe than</hi> Maimonides, <hi>for there was a great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between theſe two Doctors about the Nature of Sacrifices; but yet in the ſecond place he brings in this alſo, becauſe it was uſed ſuperſtitiouſly by the Heathens in the Worſhip of the Idol Gods. Vehajetha haha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodah hi beachilath min hadam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> 
               <q>They performed this ſuperſtitious Worſhip by eating of Blood in this manner; they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together Blood for the Devils their Idol-gods, and then they came themſelves, and did eat of that Blood with them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98888:158"/> the Devils Gueſts, and invited to eat at the Table of Devils; and ſo were joyned in federal Society with them. And by this kind of Communion with Devils, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Prophecy and foretel things to come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the laſt part of the Story of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come, though I am far from denying, that there hath been, or that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in the World, or ſuch people as <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Witches,</hi> whom the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> calls <hi>Chartoumim</hi> and <hi>Mecaſhphim, Wizards</hi> and <hi>Enchanters;</hi> yet as for this particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, all I have to ſay, is, <hi>ſit fides penes Auctorem,</hi> and <hi>credat Judaeus Apella;</hi> for I believe nothing barely upon the Teſtimony of a <hi>Rabbin,</hi> without other ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to back it; no more will any man elſe that is not in love with being impoſed upon, or that underſtands but half ſo well as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do, the extream folly and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe fellows.</p>
            <p>But when the Learned Doctor is pleaſed to tell us that <hi>there was a great controverſie</hi> between the <hi>two Rabbins,</hi> as little as they differ in name from one another, for one is <hi>Rambam</hi> and the other <hi>Ramban,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> way of <hi>Raſhei Teboth,</hi> and that this controverſie conſiſted in this that <hi>Nachmanides</hi> would have the Blood in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98888:158"/> Sacrifices to be of an expiatory nature, which <hi>Maimonides</hi> denyed, this does by the way ſufficiently diſcover how unskilful a ſcioliſt and how inſignificant a trifler the ſo much celebrated and adored <hi>Maimonides</hi> was, not withſtanding there have been thoſe that have given him this character, that he was <hi>primus Rabbinorum qui deſiit nugari.</hi> For what can be more fooliſh, nay, what can be more ſtupid, inſenſible and ſottiſh than to queſtion the truth of that which is affirmed in expreſs words by God himſelf? An Authority which without detraction a man may ſafely ſay it is at leaſt equal to that of <hi>Moſes Ben. Maimon.</hi> And he ſays thus, <hi>Levit. 17. 10, 11. whatſoever man there be of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>or of the ſtrangers, that ſojourn among you; that eateth any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Blood, I will even ſet my face againſt that Soul that eateth Blood and will cut him off from among his People. For the life is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an atonement for your Souls; for it is the Blood that maketh an atonement for the Soul.</hi> So that we ſee here that the reaſon why Blood was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to be eaten or drunk by the <hi>Jews,</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be this, becauſe <hi>it is the Blood that maketh an atonement for the Soul,</hi> and becauſe <hi>God had given it upon the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98888:159"/> Altar to make an atonement for the Souls</hi> of men. And after all this, if <hi>Maimonides</hi> will ſtill go on to lay a groundleſs claim to that unbounded priviledge called liberty of conſcience, and if in ſpite of ſo plain a text he will needs humbly conceive, with or without ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, that God himſelf is miſtaken, who can help it? <hi>Maimonides</hi> is a <hi>Rabbin,</hi> and great <hi>Rabbins</hi> and great <hi>Travellers</hi> may ſay what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Maimonides</hi> be miſtaken, yet the comfort is that <hi>Moſes Bar Nachman,</hi> who hath his name from <hi>comfort,</hi> is in the right, as how ſhould it be otherwiſe in contradictory Propoſitions, but one muſt needs be falſe, the other true; but yet as <hi>Maimonides</hi> upon examination does not appear to be full out ſo wiſe as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who certainly underſtood the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own Conſtitution, and may be allowed to explain the ſenſe of his own Laws, ſo neither is the <hi>Comforter Nachma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> altogether ſo infallible as that <hi>other Comforter,</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>John,</hi> one of whoſe great and excellent employments it is to enlighten the underſtandings, as well as to reſtrain and govern the wills of good men, and to lead them into all truth,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98888:159"/> as well as to ſtrengthen and confirm them under all temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vehajetha</hi> ſaith <hi>Nachmanides, hahavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah hi beachilath minhadam, chi hajou me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kabtſim hadam leſheedim, vehem oclim halau oumiemennou.</hi> 
               <q>They gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Blood for their Idols, and then they ate of it together with them.</q> By which words a man would think, not only that they were uſed to eat of the Blood, but alſo that gathering the Blood of ſeveral ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices together, they uſed to eat of it, as beggers do pottage, without partaking of the ſacrifices themſelves, whereas no cuſtom can be ſhewn in any Antiquity where the Blood of any ſort of Sacrifice, either among <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> was generally eaten, for as for ſingle inſtances, if any can be produced they are nothing to the purpoſe, or where the Fleſh of Sacrifices, unleſs in the Sin and Burnt Offerings, was not, and indeed it is impoſſible in the Nature of the thing, that Blood by it ſelf ſhould be the food of men, unleſs you may call that food, which is poiſon too, and which would certainly clod and coagulate in the ſtomachs of thoſe that eat it, and by that means kill them; it is a barbarity ſo contrary to nature that I believe ſcarce any Birds or Beaſts of prey, not even the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98888:160"/> Wolves not the Vulturs themſelves are ever guilty of it.</p>
            <p>Neither is this all, for it is ſtill more pleaſant what the Doctor tells us, that <hi>Maimonides</hi> going about to give the reaſon, why the eating of Blood was forbidden in the Law, he fetches it from the Idolatrous uſe of it then in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time among the <hi>Zabii;</hi> but how came this <hi>Rabbinical</hi> trifler to know what was done in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time? for unleſs he means himſelf or his Brother <hi>Nachman,</hi> the <hi>comfortable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> of the <hi>Hebraizing</hi> tribe, I am ſure he could know nothing of that other <hi>Moſes,</hi> but what is written in the Law it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The monſtrous, abſurd and ridiculous Winter tales which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> tell us are enough to blaſt the credit of their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if you conſider how long it was before either of the <hi>Talmuds</hi> were compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the one not till Two, and the other not till Five hundred Years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and theſe were the Firſt traditions that appear to have been put into writing; it is morally impoſſible, eſpecially among men ſo given to lying on the one hand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the other, as the <hi>Jews,</hi> that any certain tradition ſhould continue ſo long, as from the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> till then.</p>
            <pb n="255" facs="tcp:98888:160"/>
            <p>And as for the Traditions of <hi>Moſes</hi> from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which they call the <hi>Torah ſheba hal phi</hi> or the <hi>Oral</hi> Law, I have in my diſcourſe of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> which I intend ſhortly to publiſh, lay'd it ſo flatly and ſo fairly upon the ground, that I am very confident it will never riſe any more, and as it lies now, it is with its face downwards not daring to outface the Sun, and that which is brighter then the Sun, the truth, any longer.</p>
            <p>To conclude this firſt point, it is ſtill more pleaſant to conſider, that this reaſon which is aſſigned by <hi>Maimonides</hi> of the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blood, was not a ſingle reaſon by it ſelf, but was in conſequence of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by which he pretended to explain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other things. <hi>Multarum Legum</hi> ſaith he, <hi>rationes &amp; cauſae mihi innotuerunt, ex cognitione fidei, rituum, &amp; cultûs Zabio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> And the <hi>Doctor</hi> acquaints us, as from the <hi>Rabbin</hi> himſelf, that <hi>it was according to his principles, who thought the reaſon of all the Ceremonial Precepts was to be fetched from ſome ſuch accidental grounds.</hi> But if his Principles led him, as they did in this in inſtance of abſtaining from Blood, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the expreſs words of the Scripture and of God himſelf, what credit is to be given to the Authority of a man, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98888:161"/> not only upon ſo abſurd, but alſo upon ſo impious and deteſtable a Principle as this, or had he not as good have told us in fewer words, that he was wiſer then his Maker, and that he underſtood the meaning of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Laws better than he that made them. Beſides, that it is in general a falſe principle appears from this, that all the Ceremonies in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were for the moſt part of a <hi>Symbolical</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this is the true key which is all along to let us into their meaning, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that even this prohibition of Blood of which another reaſon hath been already aſſigned, is alſo founded upon a <hi>Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> bottom, and was intended as an aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and figurative prohibition of all ſorts of cruel and ſanguinary courſes, as appears not only from the general conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was, like the religion of all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> world, of an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> and <hi>Symbolick</hi> Nature, but alſo from the expreſs words of God himſelf in that Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> which I have laſt produced, <hi>for it</hi> (the Blood) <hi>is the life of all fleſh; the Blood of it is for the life thereof:</hi> To intimate to us that this abſtinence from Blood was intended <hi>Symbolically</hi> to denote a caution that we do not wrongfully or unjuſtly take away the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98888:161"/> life of another, and becauſe it was the <hi>life of all Fleſh,</hi> therefore it was uſed by way of expiation, God being graciouſly pleaſed to accept the life of the ſacrifice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that of the Offender himſelf, and to <hi>eat Bulls Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drink the Blood of Goats,</hi> when he might in Juſtice have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the life of men, and might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted without any wrong to any of his attributes, that he that had ſinned ſhould die in his own perſon; and I appeal to all the World, of what Credit or Authority his expoſitions or determinations ought to be, who hath either never had, or hath loſt that <hi>Symbolical</hi> Key, by which alone the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> can be opened, and inſtead of that hath ſubſtituted another in its ſtead which is ſo flat a contradiction to the expreſs words of Scripture and to the Laws it pretends to explain, a Key that may break the Lock and it ſelf, but can never fairly open the door, a Key ſo very unfit for what it pretends to do, that a pick-lock is a much more hopeful way of letting us into the ſacred Temple of Truth, than all the bunch of Keys that make ſo learned and ſo loud a noiſe at the girdle of a <hi>Rabbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this exceeding fine, when the Law of God enjoyns expreſly this Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98888:162"/> from Blood, and ſets down expreſly the particular Reaſons upon which this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence was founded; becauſe it was <hi>an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Soul;</hi> and becauſe it was the <hi>life of all fleſh;</hi> yet the <hi>Rabbins</hi> think much to pay Obedience to this Law, for the Reaſon upon which it was made, and upon which alone God expected an Obedience from them, but they will needs do it for a Reaſon of their own, becauſe the <hi>Zabians,</hi> a certain ſort of people that no body knows where or who they are, were uſed to feed upon the Sacrificial Blood, therefore, and therefore only they think it fit to abſtain; as much as to ſay, They will indeed obey the Law of God, but not out of a Principle of Obedience to him, but out of a Spirit of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their Neighbours, if indeed theſe <hi>Zabii</hi> were ſo near Neighbours to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as is pretended, and are not rather to be looked for in <hi>Lucian</hi>

            <p>The ſecond thing in which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> pretend to have received great light from the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Zabii,</hi> for the clearer underſtanding of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerns the Prohibition of ſeething of a Kid in the Milk of its Dam, <hi>Exod. 23. 19.

               <hi>It ſeems moſt probable, that this Command</hi>

               <hi>was occaſioned from a cuſtom among the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98888:163"/> Heathens, that at the time of their gathering in of Fruits, they were wont to boil a Kid in the Dam's Milk, thinking that by this means they were made acceptable to their Gods, and did procure a Bleſſing by it.</hi> And ſo having told his Tale, away goes he in ſmoaking haſte, without ſtaying to anſwer Scruples and Objections, to pack up his Awls for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, where he deſigns to be no leſs than King, and is full of Projects and Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> and I know not who beſides.</p>
            <p>But however ſince he is gone, let him go, and though it be ſcarce civil to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man behind his back, yet ſince it is neceſſary for the diſcovery of the truth, I hope we ſhall at leaſt be excuſed, and I deſire it may be conſidered to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our Cauſe, that his flying for the ſame, is a plain Argument, that he cannot anſwer what ſhall be objected.</p>
            <p>And does it then <hi>ſeem moſt probable, that this Command was occaſioned from a Cuſtom among the idolatrous Heathens;</hi> but I pray, why does it <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo? have you this upon the credit of any good Hiſtorian? then it does more than <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo; and we have the ſame reaſon to believe it with any other matter of Fact whatſoever, which our own Eyes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98888:164"/> did not ſee; but if you have it not upon any credible Teſtimony, then why does it <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo at all? or may not any thing elſe, that which is flatly contradictory to this <hi>ſeeming</hi> and incompatible with it, <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo as well? 'Tis a fine Trade indeed, when men ſhall firſt make Stories, and then believe 'em themſelves, and ſay it <hi>ſeems</hi> ſo, and then impoſe 'em upon the World, as if they were really true.

               <hi>like to this, uſed in his time in ſome parts of</hi> Spain; and we perhaps might have been ſo ſilly to believe him, if he had not ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Authority already; or if we knew diſtinctly whether this Cuſtom were among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> that we might have fair play to examine into its Truth; or if we knew what was the meaning of a <hi>Cuſtom ſomewhat like,</hi> for a <hi>Cuſtom ſomewhat like</hi> is a <hi>Cuſtom ſomewhat unlike</hi> too, and how much that is, no body knows.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>which are not grounded upon Scripture;</hi> they will ſubmit to nothing, if you cannot
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98888:164"/> prove it out of a direct Text in the Bible: and yet very honeſt Genlemen for all that, and juſt like the Diſſenters of our times, who will neither Eat nor Drink without a Text to juſtifie the Action, and believe no tales but what they make themſelves. They are no <hi>Iriſh Evidence,</hi> I aſſure you, and therefore I hope you will believe what they ſay; and that which they ſay, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was a Cuſtom of the ancient Heathens, when they had gathered in all their Fruits, to take a Kid and boil it in the Dam's milk, and then</hi> Derek Caſhephah, <hi>in a Magical way, to go about and beſprinkle with it all their Trees, and Fields, and Gardens, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,</hi> (certainly this muſt needs raiſe the price of the Commodity, and make it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as dear as <hi>Briſtol</hi> Milk) <hi>thinking by this means they ſhould make them fructifie, and bring forth fruit again more abundantly the following Year.</hi> And for this Reaſon, ſaith the Doctor, God forbad his people the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the time of their in-gathering, to uſe any ſuch Idolatrous or Superſtitious Rite.</p>
            <pb n="264" facs="tcp:98888:165"/>
            <p>And yet theſe are the Men that <hi>reject all Traditions that are not grounded on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> ſo that if we were to appeal to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the truth of this Story, all the Queſtion would be, Whether this were a Tradition of the <hi>Rabbanim</hi> for the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture which is not grounded upon the Scripture it ſelf; And the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I think, is eaſily determined, if the Doctors own Conceſſions and Quotations do not deceive us; or if the Bible of the <hi>Karraites</hi> be the ſame with ours, and that they had ſuch things as Traditions of their<note place="margin">P. 23. ib.</note> own, though they rejected thoſe of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins;</hi> and a Tradition is a Tradition let it be whoſe it will, appears from another Paſſage in his <hi>Karraitiſh</hi> M. S. where the Author tells us <hi>ſhe col Jiſrael modim,</hi> That <hi>it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that from the time of the Kingdom, they were ever wont to conſecrate the New Moons by the</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and this being a Tradition of ſo great uſe, and of ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Relation to the obſervance of their New Moons, and by conſequence of all their Feaſts, this is another Inſtance of the <hi>Karraites</hi> expounding Scripture by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And they expreſly tell us, after a little pauſe, that it is not a Tradition in <hi>general,</hi> but a Tradition of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Traditions of their <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> that is,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98888:165"/> of the <hi>Karraites</hi> themſelves, which is the thing rejected by them, if I underſtand any thing of that <hi>Hebrew</hi> Sentence, with which the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath obliged the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And yet after all, we are not ſo much beholding to Tradition for this notion, that the ancient way of computing the New Moons was by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as to the nature of the thing it ſelf, and to this honeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Reaſon, which no learned man can confute, that Eyes were made before either Almanacks or Letters.</p>
            <p>And therefore this was the ancient way of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Faſti</hi> were publiſhed by <hi>Flavius,</hi>

            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:98888:166"/>
            <p>But the chief Excellency of all of this <hi>Karraitiſh</hi> Notion is behind, for he tells us, That this hath been <hi>the Cuſtom of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ever ſince the Kingdom, to compute the New Moons by the</hi> Phaſis; as if it had not equally been ſo before, when this hath been proved by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that cannot deceive, to have been the moſt ancient way of Computation. But yet as pretty as the Tradition is, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which this Author alledges to confirm it, is ſtill more pretty than the Tradition it ſelf; <hi>the very Etymon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the word</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 24. ib.</note> Chodeſh, <hi>implies ſo much, for it ſignifies the renewing of ſomething, ſo that it is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the change of the Moon or</hi> Phaſis, <hi>as the</hi> Epocha <hi>or beginning of it.</hi> Is it ſo? but why might not this <hi>change</hi> of the Moon, which is the <hi>renewal</hi> of it, be computed either way from the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> or by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,</hi> or only by the latter of theſe, as it was actually for many Years, and then what becomes of this <hi>hopeful Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology,</hi> which concerns one way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation no more than the other, but only proceeds upon a Suppoſition, that the Moon is <hi>renewed</hi> as the <hi>Calendar</hi> does? Or, what if I ſhould prove, as I ſhall do by and by, that the middle of the Month, or the time of the full-Moon was anciently called the <hi>Renewal</hi> of it, although that <hi>Renewal</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:98888:166"/> were not meaſured by the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> but by the <hi>Calendar,</hi> and indeed by a very unequal Computation? for the <hi>Idus</hi> among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which is no other, as I ſhall ſhew, than the <hi>Hebrew Chiddouſh,</hi> and ſignifies <hi>Renovation,</hi> if the Nones were <hi>quintanae</hi> fell upon the <hi>fourteenth,</hi> but if they were <hi>ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timanae,</hi> upon the <hi>ſixteenth</hi> day of the Month; and this muſt be granted to be a conſiderable difference in the Computation, though the motion of the Moon be equal and the ſame in one Month, as another.</p>
            <p>But after all, the <hi>Karraites</hi> are like other <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and though they are all united in a common hatred againſt the <hi>Rabbanim,</hi> to whom the beſt Language they can give, is, That they are <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Tories,</hi> and all the <hi>bad Names,</hi> and <hi>ſtinking things</hi> that <hi>Billinſgate</hi> can afford, yet are they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed among themſelves, but the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of oppoſition that ſeparates them from the <hi>Traditionary Jews,</hi> divides each <hi>Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raite</hi> from his neareſt Neighbour; and for ought we know, the ſame man may be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out with himſelf, and then it will be very hard to arbitrate the difference, when a man quarrels in deſpite of himſelf, or to bring two parties to a better underſtanding, that are ſo entirely angry with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For ſo the Doctor citing a Paſſage
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98888:167"/> out of his <hi>Karraitiſh</hi> M. S. a learned Book that hath neither head nor tail, if we may believe a man that does not always ſpeak truth, ſubjoyns immediately the following words, <hi>and I produce this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

               <hi>Abrabanel, toward the end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this place, mentions a gloſs of ſome</hi> Karraiteiſh <hi>Author upon it, although it be altogether unlike to this which we have here related,</hi> ſcribunt ſapientes <hi>Karraeorum</hi> nè coquas haedum in lacte matris ſuae, hoc eſt, nè commiſceatur germen cùm radicibus.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Karraites</hi> themſelves not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly determined what to ſay, or what reaſon to aſſign of this prohibition of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſometimes referring it to an abhorrence of the <hi>Zabii,</hi> and at other times to a <hi>Symbolical</hi> reaſon, I hope we are no longer obliged by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who confeſs themſelves to be ſo much in doubt, and by their uneaſie riggling out of one way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98888:167"/> almoſt wholly upon <hi>Symbolical</hi> grounds, I affirm this laſt to be a very good ſolution of the difficulty propoſed. <hi>Nè coquas haedum in lacte matris ſuae, hoc eſt, nè commiſceatur germen cum radicibus.</hi> That is, it is a prohibition of all inceſtuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural copulations in the aſcending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending lines, for ſo if Mother and Son ſhould commit uncleanneſs together, there is in both reſpects, in the Act it ſelf and in the conſequences of it, <hi>germen cùm radicibus,</hi> and the infant begotten by ſuch a foul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as long as it continues after the firſt <hi>vitality</hi> be formed, and fed and nouriſhed in the Womb, is in the <hi>Symbolick</hi> language, ſo commonly uſed and ſo well underſtood at that time in the Eaſt, <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus in lacte matris ſuae, a kid ſeethed in the milk of its Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other expoſitions which in my own thoughts I did formerly pitch upon my ſelf, which might be aſſigned as the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this place, but not to fall too foul upon the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> where there is no occaſion, I muſt acknowledge that I am infinitely pleaſed and ſatisfied with this, though it be expreſſed after ſuch a manner, that it will require ſome thoughtfulneſs and a little dexterity in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to pick out the meaning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98888:168"/> as well as of the Text, and yet after all, I do not allow of this, as a <hi>traditionary expoſition</hi> upon the teſtimony either of a <hi>Karraite</hi> or of any other, but as an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious conjecture at the meaning of the place, and it would be hard not to allow the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſo much, as well as other men, that by conſidering a place of Scripture they may ſometimes pick out its true meaning, though it is certain they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally men of ſhallow parts, and that where there is any thing of Judgment or of nicety required, they are much oftner miſtaken then they are in the right.</p>
            <p>Such another <hi>Symbolical</hi> prohibition as this, is that of <hi>Deuter. 22. 6, 7. If a Birds neſt chance to be before thee in the way, in any Tree, or on the ground, whether they bee Young ones or Eggs and the Dam ſitting upon the Young ones, or upon the Eggs, thou ſhalt not take the Dam with the Young, but thou ſhalt in any wiſe let the Dam go, and take the Young to thee, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thy days.</hi> Which precept as well as that other of <hi>not ſeething of a Kid in the Milk of its Dam,</hi> though I make no queſtion but it was alſo <hi>literally</hi> to be obſerved, yet it was moreover a <hi>Symbolical</hi> prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all kinds and inſtances of cruelty
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98888:168"/> or injuſtice, becauſe in this caſe the young ones may be bred up by hand, and will be well enough pleaſed with the confinement of a Cage, but the old one that hath been uſed to liberty and the open air will pine and be fullen, and periſh for want of food, ſo that it is cruelty to take the Dam toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the young ones, and when the Scripture enforces a Law that is in its <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of ſo little avail or ſignification with ſo great a ſanction as this, <hi>that it may be well with thee and that thou mayeſt prolong thy days;</hi> It is as much as to ſay in more comprehenſive terms, that God will ſhew mercy to men that ſhew it to one another, but that all manner of cruelty or injuſtice his Soul hateth, and they are a perfect abomination unto him. So alſo <hi>v.</hi> 8. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>When thou build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a new Houſe, then thou ſhalt make a battelment for thy roof, that thou bring not Blood upon thine Houſe, if any man fall from thence.</hi> Not that there was ſo great danger of mens breaking their necks every day in the Week, or every hour in the day, if men had not balliſters round about upon the leads of their Houſes, or that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which thoſe rails would prevent, were great enough to compenſate even the charge of making them through all the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98888:169"/> Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the reaſon why they were ſet up being here ſo plainly ſet down, it is as much as if God had ſaid, that he intended them for a <hi>ſtanding Symbol</hi> of mercy, and that men were not only to avoid ſhedding of Blood out of <hi>ſet purpoſe</hi> and <hi>malice prepenſe,</hi> but alſo to beware as much as might be of all the <hi>accidental</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and avenues to it.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>v. 9, 10, 11. Thou ſhalt not ſow thy Vineyard with divers ſeeds, leſt the fruit of thy ſeed which thou haſt ſown and the fruit of thy Vineyard be defiled, thou ſhalt not plow with an Ox and an Aſs together, thou ſhalt not wear a Garment of divers ſorts, as of Wollen and Linnen together.</hi> Shall we think that theſe were forbidden to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves abſtained from them only out of a croſſ-graind, <hi>covenanting</hi> humour, becauſe the <hi>Zabii</hi> ſowed and plowed and were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in that manner? No certainly there can be nothing more ridiculous than to extend the <hi>Zabian Hypotheſis</hi> to all theſe prohibitions in the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> And yet nothing can be more reaſonable neither, if what <hi>Maimonides</hi> has acquainted us be true, that the practices of the <hi>Zabii</hi> are not only avoided in the abſtinence from Blood, and from the ſcething a Kid in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98888:169"/> Milk of its Dam, but are to be lay'd down as a Principle by which other Negative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are to be explained, and if this be not a true principle, as certainly it is not, how can any man think himſelf obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce barely in the Authority of <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> who is guilty of an error, that branches it ſelf out into ſo many ſeveral miſtakes, and is ſo fruitful of falſhood and deceit, without other good Authority from the reaſon of the thing, or from the teſtimony of honeſter and wiſer men? Or is not this way of ſolution, under pretence of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather to be interpreted as a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Ignorance, and as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> and the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> flye to <hi>occult qualities</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial forms</hi> when nothing elſe can be found to give a ſatisfactory anſwer; ſo here when the <hi>Rabbins</hi> are gotten into the dark, and cannot find their way out of a prohibition, they call to the <hi>Zabii</hi> to lend them their hands, and thus the blind lead the blind, and then no wonder if both of them fall into the ditch of error, inſtead of that at the bottom of which <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was uſed to ſay the truth it ſelf lay concealed. Only there is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> and the <hi>Rabbins</hi> that when the one flies to a <hi>Quiddity</hi> or an <hi>Entelechia</hi> for want of ſomething more
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98888:170"/> plain and ſatisfactory to ſay, though it be a Confeſſion of Ignorance, yet it is an Argument of Modeſty too, to acknowledge themſelves, though by an hard word, to be unequal to the Myſteries of Nature, with whoſe ſacred Depths, upon a ſerious and impartial Examination of the whole Matter, the <hi>Corpuſcularian</hi> Philoſophers will be found to be as little acquainted as the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelians</hi> themſelves; but when the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> to explain that which they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, are ſo bold to impoſe their own Figments and Inventions, as the voice of God, and the only true expoſitions of the Divine Law, what is this, but a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and execrable conjunction of the moſt childiſh Ignorance, and the moſt effronted Impudence together?</p>
            <p>But if inſtead of the Dreams of <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> and his very inconſiderate, however haughty and aſſuming Diſciples, we will ſubmit our ſelves to the infallible Conduct of that excellent Clue which the Law it ſelf has given us for our direction through the Myſterious Labyrinth of Antiquity, it will then be as difficult to loſe our way, as it is now to find it by the glaring and ſpecious, but deceitful Light of the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders.</p>
            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:98888:170"/>
            <p>The Law it ſelf gave this Reaſon why the Vineyard was not to be ſown with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Seeds, <hi>leſt the Fruit of the Seed which thou haſt ſown, and the Fruit of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard be defiled.</hi> And if you ask wherein this Defilement conſiſted, the anſwer is at hand, that it was not a Natural, but a <hi>Symbolical</hi> Defilement, it was not a <hi>real</hi> Defilement in it ſelf, but it was a <hi>Symbolical Prohibition</hi> of that which was. And the ſame account is to be given of thoſe other Prohibitions, that an <hi>Ox and an Aſs</hi> were not <hi>to Plough toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and that no man was to wear <hi>a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divers ſorts, of Linnen and Wollen</hi> together; and as the negative Precept, which hath been already explained, of <hi>not ſeething of a Kid in the milk of its Mother,</hi> was an aenigmatical Prohibition of ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Copulations in the directly or oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcending and deſcending lines, for both of theſe are equally forbidden by the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Law, ſo were theſe Laws which have been laſt recited, a modeſt and clean way of forbidding thoſe Brutalities and Beſtial Conjunctions, of which the <hi>Amorites</hi> were guilty, and which were not forbidden the <hi>Jews,</hi> only becauſe the <hi>Zabians,</hi> if any ſuch people there were, or the <hi>Amorites</hi> allowed themſelves in the practice of ſo foul, ſo horrid, ſo deteſtable a ſin; but becauſe it
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98888:171"/> was the higheſt reproach and indignity that could be put upon the Image of God in the Nature of man, becauſe it was ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Intereſt of Society, becauſe it carries in its execrable Womb ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of impiety, as no Repentance, no Prayers, no Sacrifice can expiate, becauſe it brings an Univerſal Deluge upon all thoſe wholeſome Principles of Chaſtity, Sobriety, and Religious Fear, without which no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be happy, nor any Government ſecure; or to ſum up all in a word, God does not forbid any thing for no Reaſon at all, but only for his own arbitrary Will, or out of a Peeviſhneſs inconſiſtent with the Perfection and Happineſs of his bleſſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the ſame things are practiſed by thoſe againſt whom he hath taken a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical</hi> and unaccountable Pique; but it is either upon a <hi>Symbolical</hi> Reaſon for the ſake of ſomewhat that is morally evil, or becauſe of the intrinſick and eternal Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude of the thing in its own Nature.</p>
            <p>And that this was the true reaſon of all thoſe Prohibitions which I have laſt recited, I gather from their extream reſemblance and likeneſs to one another in themſelves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Expoſition of no leſs than two of the three, which is to be found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſet down, <hi>Levit. 19. 19. Thou ſhalt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98888:171"/> not let thy Cattle gender with a divers kind: Thou ſhalt not ſow thy field with mingled Seed: neither ſhalt thou let a Garment mingled of Linen and Wollen come upon thee.</hi> Where, in the firſt place, we are to take notice, that though Cattle be only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this prohibition, yet Mankind is included under it <hi>â fortiori;</hi> becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon why ſuch unnatural Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are forbidden in Beaſts, is, becauſe they are enemies to Generation, they would ſpoil all the breeds of the ſeveral Kinds and Species in the World; and they would ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beget nothing but Monſters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the ſight, not ſitted with ſuch Organs as are neceſſary to make them Vital; or, as is ſeen in the Experience of Mules, unable to propagate themſelves by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore here our Saviours Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument takes place, <hi>Matt. 6. 26. Behold the Fowls of the Air: for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barns; yet your heavenly Father ſeedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</hi> And again, <hi>v. 28. 29, 30. And why take ye thought for Raiment? Conſider the Lillies of the fields how they grow; they toil not, neither do they ſpin. And yet I ſay unto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of theſe. Wherefore if God ſo cloath the Graſs of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98888:172"/> field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the Oven, ſhall he not much more cloath you, O ye of little Faith?</hi> And the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the inſtance of a Sparrow, is made uſe of, <hi>c. 10. 29, 30, 31. Are not two Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſold for a Farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the very hairs of your head are all numbred. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many Sparrows.</hi> And ſo I ſay in this Caſe, if God forbid the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conjunctions of different Kinds of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals for the better preſervation of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Species, he is much more to be ſuppoſed to forbid the ſame in men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe <hi>the hairs of their heads are all numbred;</hi> that is, he takes a more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous care of the Welfare of man, who is placed over the reſt of the Creatures, as God is over him; and he is in ſome ſenſe, the God of this lower World, though with reſpect to his Maker, he is but the Prieſt of this magnificent Temple, to thank, and praiſe God for himſelf, and for, and in behalf of all thoſe Creatures, that are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it for themſelves; he is Lord of the Earth, but a Servant to Heaven; he is like <hi>Eleazer,</hi> who was a Servant to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> though <hi>he ruled over all his houſe,</hi> and was the Maſter over all beſides; or like
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98888:172"/> 
               <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> to whom though <hi>Abraham</hi> payed Tithes, yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was but the Prieſt of the moſt High God, the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, God over all, bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be conſidered upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not let thy Cattle gender with a divers Kind,</hi> is this, That Cattle very ſeldom or never do gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with any Kind, but their own; and thoſe few Inſtances of this kind that are, it is perhaps impoſſible to prevent, unleſs we ſhall ſuppoſe the <hi>Jews</hi> obliged by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to ſit up day and night to watch by their Cattle, for fear of any ſuch Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Conjunctions, which I hope no man will be ſo extremely credulous and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to believe. From whence it follows plainly, that there are but two things that can be inferred from this negative Law; the firſt is this: There were then as well as now, a certain ſort of Creatures called <hi>Mules,</hi> that were of a mixt or <hi>Hybridian</hi> kind, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred betwixt Horſes and Aſſes in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction together, of which the firſt mention is made, <hi>Gen. 36. 24. This was that</hi> Anah. <hi>that found the Mules in the Wilderneſs, as he, fed the Aſſes of</hi> Zibeon <hi>his Father;</hi> And theſe, as being very fit for ſervice and for burthen, were induſtriouſly propagated by
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98888:173"/> the Husbandry of thoſe times; but becauſe they were of a mixt and Heterogeneous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe they proceeded from ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Copulations, as were ſo deteſtable in the ſight of God, becauſe they could not propagate their Kind by Generation, and becauſe all ſuch <hi>miſcellaneous</hi> and <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous</hi> things had a <hi>Levitical</hi> or <hi>Symbolical</hi> Uncleanneſs, they were forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when that is forbidden to Beaſts, which is ſo unnatural to them, that they ſcarce ever uſe it, and which ſo much as they do, it is ſcarce humanly poſſible to prevent, this is rather to be interpreted in ſuch a Senſe as if it were only a more modeſt and a more cleanly way of Prohibiting the ſame abominable Practiſes in men; as much as to ſay, Do not you, by any means, defile your ſelves though the <hi>Amorites</hi> and other Nations whom I have deſtroyed, have done it with thoſe deteſtable Inſtances of the moſt degenerate and filthy Luſt, which are a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Scandal to the Beaſts themſelves.</p>
            <p>But then in the laſt place when to this Prohibition, <hi>Thou ſhalt not let thy Cattle gender with a divers Kind,</hi> it is immediately added, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſow thy field with mingled Seed: neither ſhall a Garment min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled of Linen and Wollen come upon thee;</hi>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:98888:173"/> It is very fooliſh and abſurd to imagine, that things in their own nature perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, things that have no natural Pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Deſilement in them, ſhould be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden with the greateſt Villanies that Wickedneſs it ſelf can either deviſe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate, if it were not upon account of a <hi>Symbolical</hi> Uncleanneſs, though they have none of their own; and ſince there cannot be a <hi>more natural</hi> Symbol of Heterogeneous Copulations in Animals, than the <hi>ſowing of a field,</hi> or a <hi>Vineyard with divers ſeeds,</hi> or then the wearing a <hi>Garment of divers ſorts</hi> of Stuff, and ſince theſe are joyned in the Context with the other; I think for my part, that nothing can be more plain, than that the ſame thing is <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> Symbolical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden; and theſe Prohibitions being again inculcated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 9, 10, 11. and under ſo great a Sanction, which is to be added <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to all thoſe Laws, <hi>That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thy days:</hi> This is to ſhow us how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous the Divine Goodneſs is for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Mankind, in which all theſe Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions are manifeſtly founded; and it ought to fill us with an equal ſolicitude to pleaſe ſo merciful and ſo gracious a Being, who hath thus linked our Duty and our Intereſt together, and expects no inſtance of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98888:174"/> from us, but what is for our own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as well as it is an Act of Homage and Allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>But yet I do not ſo wholly confine my ſelf to this Interpretation of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Laws, which have been laſt recited, as to affirm, they had no other, for though that be certainly one meaning which I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, yet this hinders not, but other very probable interpretations may be admitted, as being equally connected in the <hi>Symbolical way</hi> to the types and ſhadows contained in the words of thoſe Laws; and therefore when the <hi>Jews</hi> were prohibited to <hi>Plow</hi> with an <hi>Ox</hi> and an <hi>Aſs;</hi> or wear <hi>Linſey Wolſey,</hi> or to ſow a <hi>Field</hi> or <hi>Vineyard</hi> with <hi>two ſorts</hi> of Seeds, another meaning of theſe <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> Precepts may very well be ſuppoſed to be one of <hi>theſe two things,</hi> or indeed both of them together.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They were forbidden under theſe Types and Figures all manner of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> they were not to have <hi>an heart and an heart,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew Idiom</hi> excellently expreſſes it, but their Actions and Pretences were to be of the ſame Grain and Colour with one another, and their outward Appearances were to be but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the original Realities within. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the ſame Prohibitions they were
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98888:174"/> 
               <hi>aenigmatically</hi> forwarned againſt all kind of <hi>lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>indifference,</hi> they were to be <hi>true Blew,</hi> not <hi>parti-colour'd</hi> men, or of a <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>Yellow</hi> dye, not <hi>Phy'lemorts,</hi> not halters between two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and different opinions; for ſyncerity and heartineſs in every thing we do, is ſo much for the benefit of the world, and for the intereſt of mankind, and ſo like to God, who is the fountain of truth, and is what he is to the utmoſt of himſelf, that though the ſacrifice of the wicked be an abomination to him, yet open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf is an acceptable ſacrifice in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>coldneſs</hi> and <hi>indifference</hi> and <hi>diſſimulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Law which I ſhall mention to ſhew that the <hi>Zabians</hi> do not keep the Key of the Cabinet of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but that the true Method of finding out the meaning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all his Inſtitutions, is to ſearch for it in the <hi>Symbolick</hi> or <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> way, ſhall be that of <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 23, 24, 25. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fruits of Trees. <hi>And when ye ſhall come into the Land, and ſhall have Planted all manner of Trees for Food, then ye ſhall count the Fruit thereof as uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: Three Years ſhall it be as uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98888:175"/> unto you, it ſhall not be eaten of. But in the fourth Year all the Fruit thereof ſhall be Holy to Praiſe the Lord withal; and in the fifth Year ſhall ye eat of the Fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it may yield unto you the Increaſe thereof I am the Lord your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I dare appeal to all Mankind, would it not be very pleaſant to ſay, the reaſon why the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo long before they Offered of their Fruits to God, and ſo much longer before they partook of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, was to be taken from the <hi>Zabii,</hi> who were uſed to do theſe things either ſooner or later than the <hi>Jews</hi> are commanded to do? Or would it not be every whit as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable to ſay, that the reaſon why the <hi>Jews</hi> are any Victuals at all, was becauſe the <hi>Zabii</hi> never did? And yet there is no help for it; but the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Zabii</hi> muſt explain this Law as well as any other, if it be true that their Practiſes are to be laid down as an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> by which the reaſon of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <p>But not to concern our ſelves any further with this miſerable tool of an Expedient, the moſt fooliſh and ridiculous that ever was invented. The <hi>Fruit</hi> was <hi>uncircumciſed;</hi> that is, it was unhallowed, or unclean, or unlawful to be uſed for <hi>three Years,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98888:175"/> till after then, their Juice was crude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted, and therefore it was yet unfit to be Offered to God, to whom, as every thing which was uſed in Food, was in ſome ſmall proportion firſt to be Conſecrated and Offered up, that ſo the <hi>Primitiae</hi> might Hallow and Sanctifie the uſe of the reſt; and that by this means an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be made, to whom they were indebted for all the Neceſſaries, and all the Conveniencies or Delicacies of Humane Life, ſo was the Offering to be of the beſt in its kind, becauſe this was a Teſtimony of the moſt profound reſpect, and was an acknowledgment of the Excellence of his Nature. And then after this it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be eaten, but not before; for the ſame reaſon for which it was unlawful in other Caſes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to eat of that of which no part had before hand been Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> by way of Acknowledgment and Thankfulneſs to the giver of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of theſe Fruit-Trees it is ſaid, <hi>When ye ſhall come into the Land, and ſhall have Planted all manner of Trees for food,</hi> to intimate, that of thoſe Trees of which there was no uſe in Food, there was no need to make any Offering neither; as it was in Animals, for the unclean Beaſts which were not permitted in Food, would
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98888:176"/> not be accepted in Sacrifice neither. And ſo in proportion, thoſe Creatures that are the ſooneſt in a condition to be eaten, are likewiſe the ſooneſt fit for Sacrifice, as I gather from that of <hi>Pliny, l. 8. c. 51. Suis foetus Sacificio die quinto purus eſt, pecoris die octavo.</hi> For both theſe Animals being permitted in Food among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were uſed to abuſe the <hi>Jews</hi> for their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from Swines Fleſh, and among whom the <hi>Sumen</hi> was accounted ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Diſh; the Reaſon why one was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being Sacrificed ſooner than the other, was without queſtion to be derived from this, that it was ſooner fit for Food.</p>
            <p>Farther yet as another argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what hath been already very largely repreſented upon this Subject, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did neither forbid nor command any thing, how commodious or hurtful ſoever the thing forbidden or commanded might be in it ſelf, meerly becauſe the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> or the <hi>Zabians</hi> or any other <hi>Heathen</hi> Nation did either practiſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow it, I ſhall inſtance in Circumciſion it ſelf which was the peculiar mark of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God had entred into with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Poſterity, &amp; whichr ſeems to have been parctiſed very anciently, among theall <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,

            <p>Add to all this that the reaſon why the Servant was to be let free in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year, was it ſelf alſo of a <hi>Symbolical</hi> nature, in memory of that <hi>great ſabbatiſme</hi> after the Creation of the World was finiſhed, upon which alſo the <hi>weekly Sabbath</hi> and the <hi>Sabbatical Year,</hi> and the Year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> which was the <hi>great ſeptenary</hi> multiplyed into it ſelf, depended; but though at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the ſixth Year, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was at liberty himſelf, yet he could not carry his Wife and Family along with him, in caſe he did not bring them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but Married while himſelf was in the condition of a Servant, to another Servant of the ſame Family, becauſe in this caſe ſhe was only <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuaria,</hi> and the Maſter of the Houſe did not loſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in her as a Servant, by ſuffering ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enjoy her as an Husband, and for the ſame reaſon the ſeventh year being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to releaſe the Perſon of him, who had put himſelf into a Voluntary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it did not extend to thoſe who were born in a ſtate of bondage, and did not come into the poſſeſſion of their Maſter by Compact or Agreement.</p>
            <pb n="291" facs="tcp:98888:178"/>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding, though they were not releaſed together with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Seventh year, yet being come of <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> race, they were not in a ſtate of perpetual ſervitude neither, but were to come out at the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> and if the <hi>Seventh</hi> year, and the year of <hi>Jubile</hi> were coincident, then he and his Children were to go free together, Levit. 25. 41. <hi>Then he ſhall depart from thee, both he and his Children with him,</hi> and the ſame muſt be underſtood of his Wife alſo, ſuppoſing ſhe were of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for this was the general Rule that none of their own Nation, upon any pretence whatſoever, without their own conſent and choice were to be an <hi>Haereditary</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> poſſeſſion, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 45, 46. and the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> being the time when all things were reſtored to the old and true Proprietors, this was the time, when the diſpoſal of every Man and Womans Perſon, as well as of <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>unalienable</hi> Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did Naturally devolve upon themſelves again; ſo that when it is ſaid, Exod. 21. 7. <hi>If a Man ſell his Daughter to be a Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, ſhe ſhall not go out as the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants do,</hi> this muſt be underſtood only of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year, not of the year of <hi>Jubile</hi> when all things were reſtored, and as the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98888:179"/> reaſon why the Maid and the Man-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had not equal Priviledge, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the different Eſteem and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which the one Sex had above the other in thoſe times, ſo the reaſon why ſhe alſo was reſtored to freedom at the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> is to be referred, as hath been ſaid to this, that no perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of the Hebrew race, was to be an everlaſting and perpetual ſlave.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſidered the <hi>Zabian Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> of which Doctor <hi>Cudworth</hi> is ſo fond, and upon which he hath thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſo much Hebrew to no purpoſe, a thing as full of Oſtentation, and as empty of truth, as it's aſſertour; it is now high time to look back, and to conſider what it was which gave occaſion to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe<note place="margin">Pag. 237. <hi>Supra.</hi>

            <p>And that this equality of Inheritances, which was engrafted into the Laws, not only of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and from

            </p>
            <p>And how could it poſſibly be otherwiſe, where Uſury was publickly allowed, and extortion privately practiſed, where Lands, when they were ſold, were ſold out-right, without any Year of <hi>Jubile</hi> in which they were to return to the old poſſeſſour again, but that a difference, as there will always be between one man and another, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Frugality, Ingenuity, Craft, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and the like, muſt very ſoon make the induſtry of one encroach upon the ſloath, the frugality of one upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs, the ingenuity of one upon the dullneſs, the Ambition of one upon the Indifference, and the Knavery of one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the honeſt and undeſigning temper of another.</p>
            <p>From whence it came to paſs in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of not many years, that the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion was ſo great, that it began to be complained of as a grievance by the poorer<note place="margin">Liv. l. 6.</note> ſort, which occaſioned that Law of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius Stolo, ne quis plus quingenta agri Jugera poſſideret;</hi> which Law was afterwards broken by himſelf, and he ſeverely ſined,<note place="margin">ib. l. 7.</note>

            <p>1. <hi>And there was a great cry of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of their Wives, againſt their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the</hi> Jews. 2. <hi>For there were that ſaid, We, our Sons and our Daughters are many: therefore we take up Corn for them, that we may eat, and live. 3. Some alſo there were that ſaid, We have Mortgaged our Lands, Vineyards, and Houſes, that we might buy Corn, becauſe of the dearth. 4. There were alſo that ſaid, We have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed money for the Kings tribute, and that upon our Lands and Vineyards. 5. Yet now our Fleſh is as the Fleſh of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our Children as their Children: and lo, we bring into bondage our Sons and our Daughters, to be Servants, and ſome of our Daughters are brought into bondage already, neither is it in our power to redeem them: for other men have our Lands and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. 6. And I</hi> (Nehemiah) <hi>was very angry when I heard their cry, and theſe words. 7. Then I conſulted with my ſelf, and I rebuked the Nobles, and the Rulers,

               </gap>, that is, <hi>that the Nations round about made perpetual inroads upon them, pillaging and ravaging the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the day, and ſurpriſeing their Towns and Villages in the night, and filling all the ways and paſſages with heaps of dead Bodies.</hi> And though this inſolence at the inſtance of <hi>Nehemiab</hi> were not long after ſeverely forbidden by the Decree of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> or <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Son of <hi>Darius,</hi> yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not but <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and their adherents did ſtill do all they could to plague and torment the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to hinder them from repairing the Ruins of their ſlighted Wall <hi>Nehem. c.</hi> 4. ſo that they were forced the one half of them to be a guard to the reſt, while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their work, and the other half in a mixt condition betwixt that of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and military perſons, were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated<note place="margin">Nehem. 4. v 13. ad fin. cap.</note> to hold a Sword in one hand, while they employed a Trowel with the other.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of which was, that the Land all this while lay unmanured, while the people were all of them ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98888:184"/> taken up in the defence of themſelves, and in the building of their Wall and City, and if they had Tilled and Sowed, or Planted their ground with never ſo much induſtry and care, yet it could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in this poſture of affairs, but the Enemy would either have ſpoil'd and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they had done, or being ſo ſtrong as they were in the Country round about, while the <hi>Jews</hi> were all of them employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and in the<note place="margin">Nehem. 4. 22.</note> defence of the builders, they would have enjoyed the Fruits of what the others had Planted and Sown.</p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe cauſes, as very well they might, produced a <hi>Dearth</hi> of Corn and of all manner of ſuſtenance among the <hi>Jews, Nehem.</hi> 5. 3. and this <hi>Dearth</hi> which was enhaunſed by this, that they were not only to maintain themſelves and Families, but<note place="margin">v. 4.</note> were alſo to pay a Tribute to the King, compelled them to <hi>mortgage their Lands,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Which things being premiſed, for the better underſtanding the true ſtate of affairs at that time, I ſhall now for the explication of this Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> do theſe two things. Firſt, I ſhall ſhew in what ſort and manner, and to what degree Uſury was practiſed among the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations. And Secondly, I ſhall ſhew that the Old Laws and Uſages of the <hi>Romans</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Uſury, were derived from thence.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt of theſe, that is to ſay, in what ſort and manner and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Uſury was practiſed among the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, or at leaſtwiſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well before as after their return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> may be ſeen from this place of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſome other places in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and in the general it is certain, that Uſury was two fold, it was either increaſe of Money, or increaſe of Victuals, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of any thing neceſſary or convenient for the ſupport of humane life; as hath
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98888:185"/> been already ſufficiently declared, and this Uſury in reſpect of the difficulties to which it reduced thoſe who were involved in it, was called in Hebrew <hi>Neſhec</hi> from a word that ſignifies to <hi>bite,</hi> becauſe in time it <hi>ate</hi> quite through their Eſtates, and in like manner all kind of Extortion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Exaction is by the <hi>Turks</hi> called <hi>eating</hi> at this day, and this is the very word by which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> deſcribes the unjuſt man, and the oppreſſour. <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledg? who eat up my people as they would eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 14. 4. and 53. 4. and as with relation to the party borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was called <hi>Neſhec,</hi> ſo with reſpect to the lender, there are two words by which it is expreſt, <hi>Tarbith</hi> and <hi>Marbith,</hi> both from the ſame root, and both ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>improvement</hi> or <hi>increaſe,</hi> but in caſe they could not duely pay their Uſe, or being reduced to extream want, having but juſt a bare ſubſiſtence for themſelves, and perhaps hardly that, they could not pay it any longer, then if they had any Lands or Vineyards, or Houſes, they were forced to Mortgage or Paun them till the year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> Laſtly in caſe of a ſtill greater neceſſity which ſometimes happened, as it did in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> days by reaſon of the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98888:186"/> Famine and the Kings Tribute, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Tirſhatha's</hi> allowance were not exacted; then they ſold themſelves or elſe their Sons and their Daughters into bondage, by virtue of that abſolute power and Authority which they had over them, the Men till the Seventh year, and the Women till that of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> the reaſons of which difference have been already explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>If you ask to what degree this Uſury was exacted, the Text of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tells you expreſly, it was <hi>the Hundreth part of the Money, and of the Corn, the Wine and the Oyl.</hi> Hebr. <hi>Meath hacheſeph Vehada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, &amp;c.</hi> but the Seventy have Tranſlated it to another ſenſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.) The ſenſe of which is that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemias</hi> not only exhorted the Creditors to reſtore the Lands, and Vineyards, and Houſes which they had in Mortgage, but alſo out of their own Pockets to furniſh their neceſſitous Neighbours and Kindsmen; for it was they, who were the firſt Mortgagers in all theſe caſes, with whatſoever was neceſſary for their preſent ſupport; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seventy inſtead of <hi>Meath</hi> read it <hi>Meeth</hi> with a very little alteration: but, I confeſs, I prefer the <hi>Maſorethical</hi> reading
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98888:186"/> before it, not only becauſe the condition might ſeem too hard to be ſubmitted to, that they ſhould reſtore the Principle and forgive the Uſe, and furniſh them <hi>de ſuo</hi> with large contributions for their ſupport into the bargain, but alſo becauſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who as I have ſaid, as to the caſe of Uſury, received all their cuſtoms from the <hi>Jews,</hi> did exact it in the ſame proportion in which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> affirms the Creditors among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in his time to have done, as ſhall be ſhown more largely by and by.</p>
            <p>And to begin with Names before we paſs to other particular circumſtances of the matter in queſtion, there are two names in Latin by which the Principle, and two by which the Uſury of it was expreſt. The Principle was either <hi>caput</hi> or <hi>ſors,</hi> and the advantage redounding from it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Faenus</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſura,</hi> all which are plainly and unqueſtionably Hebrew, or at leaſt Oriental Names; <hi>Caput</hi> is manifeſtly the Hebrew <hi>Gabhouth,</hi> by which any ſort of <hi>Eminence,</hi> or <hi>Hill,</hi> or <hi>Top</hi> of any thing was aptly ſignified, ſo that nothing can anſwer more exactly either in word or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification then the Hebrew does to the Latin, and thence the Capitol was called not a <hi>Capite Toli,</hi> as the Roman Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, who did not underſtand their own
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98888:187"/> Language, ignorantly tell us, but it was as much as <hi>Gabhouth el</hi> or <hi>Gabhouth al,</hi> more broadly according to the manner of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> whoſe <hi>a</hi> is as broad as the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi> and does almoſt anſwer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of <hi>o,</hi> as much as to ſay the <hi>Hill of God,</hi> or the <hi>Hill</hi> where <hi>God</hi> was anciently Worſhiped, as it was the cuſtom all over the Eaſt, from whence I make no queſtion but the <hi>Romans</hi> were a Colony) to Worſhip God in <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>High places</hi> whence <hi>Ramah,</hi> and <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and <hi>Gilboah</hi> had their names, as being ſuch Eminences or High places, as it ſeems, ſet apart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>And ſuch another account as this, is to be given of ſeveral other of thoſe famous ſeven Hills upon which the old <hi>Rome</hi> was afterwards built, the <hi>Mons Palatinus</hi> is not <hi>à balandò,</hi> as the Roman Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would needs have it to ſignifie, but it is from the Hebrew <hi>Phillel,</hi> from whence with an <hi>Heemantique</hi> is the noun <hi>Tephillah,</hi> which being rejected, as not belonging to the root, <hi>mons Palatinus</hi> is the Mountain of Prayer, ſo alſo the <hi>Vatican</hi> Mountain, is as much as, <hi>har Hahatik,</hi> the <hi>Old Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> where the firſt Planters of the Colony ſeem to have Worſhipped God, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>hajin</hi> into an <hi>Aeolique Digamma,</hi>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:98888:187"/> which anſwers to the Latin <hi>v</hi> conſonant and <hi>f,</hi> of which I ſhall give more inſtances very ſuddenly, for that it is not <hi>à vatibus,</hi> according to the Latin Analogy, is clear from this, that the Syllable <hi>ti</hi> in <hi>vatibus</hi> is <hi>ſhort,</hi> but in <hi>vaticanus long</hi> according to that of <hi>Martial</hi>

            <p>Again the <hi>eſquiliae</hi> or the <hi>mons eſquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> had its name from the Thickets or Groves that grow upon it, for that is the ſignification of <hi>Eſhel</hi> in Hebrew, whence was the Latin <hi>Aſilum,</hi> and as the name ſo the thing it ſelf, was derived from the Cities of Refuge among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as the <hi>pomeria</hi> among the <hi>Latins,</hi> which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>aliquid extra &amp; intra muros vacui at humano cultu ſoli,</hi> for the Cities of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and conſequently thoſe of

            <p>But enough of this, I could ſhow the ſame of the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hills, that they had their names from the Eaſt, which is ſufficient to prove the inhabitants of that place to have been a Colony from thence; but I return to the buſineſs of Uſury which occaſioned this digreſſion, and the Second name by which the Principal ſum is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Latin, is <hi>Sors,</hi> which is derived from the Hebrew <hi>Joreſh,</hi> ſignifying an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Eſtate; and becauſe the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances among the <hi>Jews</hi> were divided by <hi>lot,</hi> therefore <hi>ſors</hi> in Latin does alſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>chance</hi> or <hi>fortune,</hi> and <hi>ſortes</hi> are lots, and <hi>ſortiri</hi> is to caſt lots, or to obtain by lot.</p>

            <p>Theſe are the two words by which the Principle is ſignified in the Latin tongue, the uſe as hath been ſaid is either <hi>faenus</hi> or <hi>uſura.

               </gap>, which is proportionably the ſame in Uſury as in confiſcation. Laſtly, <hi>utor,</hi> and <hi>uſus,</hi> and <hi>uſura,</hi> are the firſt of them from <hi>Hathar</hi> in <hi>Chalday,</hi> the two laſt from <hi>Haſar</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſignifying a <hi>tenth,</hi> becauſe this was the ancient <hi>uſura centeſima,</hi> or in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Nehemiah, the hundreth part of the Money, the Corn, the Oyl, and the Wine.</hi> For the year anciently conſiſted of ten Months, before it was reduced (by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees, and upon neceſſary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions becauſe of the ſeaſons of the Year, as it were ſhifting their courſe, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſucceſſively through all the Months) to a perfect equation with the motion of the Sun, and one in an hundred for one
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98888:189"/> Month, is ten in the hundred for the year, as afterwards by the addition of two other Months it came to be twelve in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and that we may underſtand the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how perfect the analogy is, it is to be obſerved, that as <hi>haſar</hi> is <hi>decimare,</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the <hi>tenth,</hi> or <hi>uſe</hi> of any thing, for one in the hundred, for one Month is ten in the hundred, that is one in ten, a tenth of the whole, for the uſe of an year, ſo in <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal, mehouſar,</hi> or by letting out the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>honſar,</hi> is <hi>id quod decimatum eſt,</hi> or <hi>id omne quodcunque uſurae nomine accipitur.</hi> So that I think there is nothing at all preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in this account, unleſs it be that one of theſe two things do not ſeem ſufficiently proved.

            <p>But this by his favour could not be a good reaſon, neither can it be thought a likely matter, that a wiſe Man living a great many Years in the World, and obſerving in every one of them the ſeaſons of the Year, and by conſequence the courſe of the Sun, ſhould think the ſolar Year to conſiſt but of ten Months; for if you go by the Lunar, thoſe ten Months will be ſo many ſeveral Years, being ſo many ſeveral compleat and entire deſcriptions of the Lunar Circle, and indeed ſomething more, if you aſſign thirty days to each Month; which I ſhall prove by and by to have been the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ten Month Year; neither was <hi>Ovid</hi> himſelf ſatisfied with this ſolution, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his ſubſtituting two others in its ſtead, one of which is, that this was that Period of time wherein the Widow was uſed to mourn for her deceaſed Husband.</p>

            <pb n="315" facs="tcp:98888:190"/>
            <p>And this I do not deny to be a poſſible reaſon, but I am far from thinking it is the true one; nay, I am rather of opinion that the contrary is true, that is, that the reaſon why the Year conſiſted of ten Months, was not becauſe the Widow mourned ſo long for her Husband, but the reaſon why the Widow mourned ſo long, and no longer for her Husband, was becauſe it was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary to mourn for a Year in this caſe, and the ancient Year conſiſted of ten Months, though the time of mourning was not inlarged together with the Year, as many of our cuſtoms depend upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are now long ſince expired and forgotten, but I ſpeak this only with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> for at this day it is manifeſt that the Year of mourning is meaſured by the Sun.</p>
            <p>But the true reaſon of this ancient Year conſiſting of ten Months is yet behind, and is aſſigned by <hi>Ovid</hi> in the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceding thoſe which I have newly cited, namely that it was taken from the time of Child-bearing, or from the uſual Period that is found to paſs from the time of conception to that of parturition.</p>

            <p>And this diſcovers withal from whence the <hi>Romans</hi> had their ancient Year, for there is no queſtion but they received it from the Eaſt, where there was ſuch a Period of ten Months taken from this laſt reaſon which <hi>Ovid</hi> aſſigns, and which was properly and peculiarly called the time of life. So the Angel called it in his promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Gen. 18. 10. <hi>I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo</hi> Sarah <hi>thy Wife ſhall have a Son.</hi> And that this time was a fixt and certain Period, by which it was well underſtood, what time was meant in thoſe days, appears plainly by <hi>v.</hi> 14. where it is called <hi>the appointed time.

            <p>Further that the Romulian Year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ten Months was without queſtion taken from the Eaſt, may appear by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for both thoſe names are taken from the Eaſt, <hi>Rome</hi> is from <hi>Rom, excelſum eſſe, exaltari,</hi> and may ſignifie any high place whatſoever, as <hi>Ramah</hi> and <hi>Gibeon</hi> might alſo have done, though they have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to two particular places; and <hi>Romulus</hi> is the God of that high place, by the addition of <hi>el.

            <p>The manner of <hi>Romulus</hi> his being tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Heaven, according to the relation of thoſe who pretended to be Eye witneſſes of it, was either a pretended imitation or a manifeſt corruption of the ſtories of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> in the ſacred Volume, and the ſtratagem by which the <hi>Romans</hi> procured Wives to themſelves, having none of that Sex among them, by inviting the <hi>Sabines</hi> to come and ſee the <hi>Conſualia</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by them in Honour of <hi>Neptunus Equeſtris,</hi> is anſwered exactly by the ſtory of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> with relation to the Daughter of <hi>Shiloh</hi> in the laſt Chapter of the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> ſo that not only as to names and words, but as to events and things themſelves there is a plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable <hi>Orientaliſm</hi> in the Roman ſtory, as is evident before we leave <hi>Romulus</hi> by the name of <hi>Rhea</hi> the veſtal Virgin (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98888:194"/> 
               <hi>Salii</hi> were the Prieſts of <hi>Mars,</hi> twelve in number, with Shields or Targets called <hi>Ancilia,</hi> from <hi>El</hi> or <hi>Al</hi> which the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Sol,</hi> as much a <hi>Solii,</hi> the Prieſts in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of God, or more particularly of the Sun, to which all the <hi>Heathen</hi> Deities are reduced by <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and I appeal to any Man whether this be not a better <hi>Etymon</hi> then the common one a <hi>Saliendo,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you conſider theſe two things; Firſt, What <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us, that in his time the <hi>Salii</hi> did not underſtand their own Songs, and ſolemn Hymns, which ſhews then to have been written in ſome Exotique Language and probably in the Eaſtern. And Secondly, That the ſame perſons are by <hi>Catullus, Epigr.</hi> 17. called <hi>Saliſubſuli,</hi> which, if this Etymology were true, would be at once <hi>à ſaliendo &amp; à ſubſiliendo,</hi> which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect non-ſenſe as any thing can be.</p>
            <p>Again, their Arms or Targets were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ancilia,</hi> not <hi>ab Ancidendo,</hi> as the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians would have it, without any ground in Analogy to favour their conjecture, but becauſe the <hi>Salii</hi> in their dances were uſed, as I conceive, in certain meaſures to beat or play upon their Shields, ingeminating theſe words in honour of their God, <hi>Een ca el, Een ca el, there is none like God,</hi> or <hi>there is none like our God,</hi> which it is very
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98888:194"/> natural and eaſie for any Man to conceive them to have done.

               </gap> was a promontory towards the Sea ſide, from whence the whole Coaſt might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well derive its name; and I hope this may paſs for as handſome a conjecture, as the <hi>ab Illaa</hi> of ſome other Learned men, upon no better grounds then only becauſe <hi>Feſtus</hi> who did not underſtand the punick Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, hath been pleaſed to tell us, that <hi>Abyle</hi> in that Language does ſignifie <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem excelſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let that be as it will, yet that by <hi>Havilah, Africa</hi> is underſtood, is plain to me from what is added concerning the place, Gen. 2. 11, 12. <hi>There is Gold, and the Gold of that Land is good,</hi> For the Gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> was famous all over the Eaſt, and <hi>Ophir</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> are the ſame, and ſo were <hi>Ophir</hi> and <hi>Havilah</hi> in a manner the ſame, that is, they were both the Sons of <hi>Joktan,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:98888:197"/> Gen.</hi> 10. 29. and both of them probably co-planters and co-inhabitants of the ſame Country, whence it was called by ſome <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilah</hi> and by others <hi>Ophir,</hi> whence the Latin <hi>After</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> are derived.</p>
            <p>And now there is only the <hi>Soſos</hi> to be conſidered, which was a Period of Sixty Days, or Two ſolar Months, from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Shiſh,</hi> which perhaps by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> was called <hi>Shouſh,</hi> ſignifying Sixty, as the Plural <hi>Shiſhim</hi> in Hebrew ſtands for Sixty.</p>
            <p>So that it is now clear, which was the Firſt thing to be proved, that there was anciently in the Eaſt a Period of time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Ten Months, allowing to each Month Thirty Days, which in the Sacred ſtory is called <hi>the time of Life,</hi> and which being doubled did conſtitute the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> againſt which if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that even ſo long ago as in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Floud, the Year is repreſented as conſiſting of Twelve Months; to this there are two things to be anſwered, Firſt, That <hi>Moſes</hi> in his account of the Floud does with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion reduce the Years of that age, which to me ſeem to have been only Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar, to the Calculation of his own time, but becauſe Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in a late Book of his,<note place="margin">Theory of the Earth.</note> the deſign of which I do by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, though otherwiſe I acknowledg him
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98888:198"/> to be an excellent perſon, hath made it his buſineſs Elaborately to defend the Years of the Patriarcks to have been ſolar Years, which I do no more believe, then I do that they were ſo many ſeveral revolutions of the Circle of <hi>Saturn,</hi> therefore I will take time to conſider further of it. But a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond anſwer to this objection, which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the pretended length of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidiluvian</hi> Years, is this, that theſe two Periods the <hi>ſolar</hi> and that of <hi>Ten Months,</hi> are not inconſiſtent together, ſince nothing hinders but that they might both be uſed at the ſame time, not only with relation to different things, but alſo to the ſame, though by a different way and meaſure of compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as it is certain before <hi>Eliſha's</hi> time that the Year of <hi>Twelve Months</hi> obtained amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as is manifeſt by <hi>Davids</hi> Calculation of the Years of human life, ariſing no higher then <hi>Threeſcore and ten</hi> or <hi>Fourſcore,</hi> which is the uſual Period of it now a days, in ſuch as live temperately and are ſtrongly made, but yet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> long after <hi>Davids</hi> time, makes mention of <hi>the time of life,</hi> which was a Period of <hi>Ten Months,</hi> as hath already been proved, and ſo the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> at the ſame time they had their <hi>Neiros,</hi> had their <hi>Saros</hi> alſo, one of which was a Period meaſured by <hi>the time
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98888:198"/> of life,</hi> and the other by the <hi>ſolar Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am far from denying, that the ſolar Year was in the Eaſt a very ancient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of time, it was as ancient as <hi>Numa</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> who to the <hi>Ten</hi> of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> added <hi>Two</hi> more, and thoſe both of them as to their very names taken from the Eaſt, but what was the exact form of <hi>Numa's</hi> Year, is not ſo eaſie at this diſtance of time to tell, only thus much we know from what <hi>Livy</hi> hath enformed us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that to ſpeak properly it was neither <hi>Lunar</hi> nor <hi>Solar,</hi> only it conſiſted of <hi>Twelve Months,</hi> and that the intercalations of each beyond the <hi>Lunar</hi> Year were ſo ordered, as that in <hi>Twenty Years</hi> time the account was made even, and the New Moon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered exactly to the ſame place; from whence the Sun ſet out Twenty Years ago.

               <hi>Numa's</hi> Year as I have ſaid was neither <hi>perfectly Solar</hi> nor <hi>Lunar,</hi> not <hi>perfectly Solar,</hi> becauſe it did not conſiſt of perfectly Solar Months, by reaſon of the different inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calations in different Months, ſo that the Sun in each Month did not deſcribe an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <hi>ſegment</hi> of the Solar Circle, (and yet in this ſenſe it might then, as it may now be ſaid to have been Solar, becauſe the Months were ſo ordered, that at the end of Twelve of them, the Sun returned to the ſame point of the Heavens from whence he ſet out Twelve Months before;) nor <hi>perfectly Lunar</hi> neither, becauſe of the ſame Intercalations, which were ſometimes one, and ſometimes two Days longer then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Lunar Circle; But now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Solar Year to be as it is, about Thirty Days longer then Twelve compleat Revolutions of the Lunar, and ſuppoſing firſt one, and then two Days every other Month, to be added by way of Intercalation to the courſe of the Moon, it muſt of neceſſity ſo happen that the Intercalations muſt fall every Month lower into the age and courſe of the Moon, and in twenty Lunar Months by this alternate Intercalation of one and two Days, there would in the whole be an
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98888:199"/> Intercalation of thirty days, which is the ſpace of a Solar Month or thereabouts, (and what it wants may be adjuſted by the Intercalation of an odd Day in certain Months,) ſo that it is manifeſt the Interca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But I confeſs this is an hard expoſition of <hi>eadem meta,</hi> but though the place of <hi>Livy</hi> be not to be underſtood of Twenty Lunar Months, but Solar Years, yet this which I have ſaid concerning the <hi>Intercalations</hi> or <hi>Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſms</hi> at the end of the Lunar Months, will,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:98888:200"/> if attended to, infallibly conduct us to the truth it ſelf, for if the New Moon by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this intercalation, be at the end of Twenty Months again co-incident with the beginning of a Monthly <hi>ſegment</hi> of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Year, then there being Twelve, ſuch <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidences</hi> in Twenty Years, all of them happening from one another at the diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Twelfth part or <hi>ſegment</hi> of the Solar Circle; for Twelve times Twenty Months, is Twenty times Twelve Months, it will unavoidably happen that at the end of Twenty Years theſe <hi>co-incidences</hi> will have run through the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> and will fall upon the ſame point from whence they firſt ſet out, which is an exact Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words of <hi>Livy; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t vigeſimo quoque anno ad metam eandem ſolis unde orſi eſſent, plenis annorum omnium ſpatiis, dies congruerent.</hi>

            <p>The Second inſtance is in the <hi>Hebrew heth,</hi> whence is the <hi>Latin fatum; heth</hi> is a <hi>time</hi> or an <hi>appointed time,</hi> and <hi>fatum</hi> is that hour which preſides over ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times and ſeaſons, and brings every thing to paſs in its predeſtin'd and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd order, according to the opinion of the ancients, as is manifeſt by that place of <hi>Seneca</hi> and by many others, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the ſentiments of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> he ſays, <hi>Eadem neceſſitas etiam deos alligat, irrevocabilis divina pariter ac hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana curſus vehit, ille ipſe omnium conditor ac rector, ſcripfit quidem fata, ſed ſequitur, ſemper paret, ſemel juſſit;</hi> and juſt ſo <hi>Ovid</hi> deſcribes his <hi>Janus</hi> as having the dominion of all things both in Heaven and Earth, in words that have been already taken notice of; and again, a little after, <hi>Janus</hi> ſaith of himſelf,</p>

            <p>But I confeſs I am of <hi>Ovid's</hi> firſt opinion, that the ancient Year of <hi>Romulus</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>ten Months,</hi> Firſt, Becauſe <hi>March</hi> was manifeſtly the beginning of a Year in ſome ancient account or other, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the names of <hi>Quintilis, Sextilis, September,</hi> &amp;c. which are computed from it. Secondly, The <hi>Saturnalia</hi> were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in <hi>December,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> ſeems to have been Worſhipped in <hi>Italy</hi> long before the times of <hi>Numa</hi> or of <hi>Romulus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as they are uſually computed, and much more of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> he ſeeming to be the very ancienteſt of all the Deities wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in that Country, as may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear from what hath been already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Thirdly, The name of the Month <hi>Martius,</hi> which is from <hi>Mars</hi> is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Hebrew Origination,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Decemviri</hi> received all their

            <p>And thence <hi>Quirites,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>Haſtati,</hi> who were a particular Order of Souldiers in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camps, as may be ſeen in many places of <hi>Livy,</hi> and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Formative, and diſſolving the Guttural, as in the Latin <hi>Mars,</hi> is the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Wherefore my opinion upon the whole matter is, that the Year of <hi>Romulus,</hi> as I have ſaid, conſiſted of <hi>ten Months,</hi> and that theſe <hi>two</hi> Months were added after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Numa,</hi> and taken from the Eaſt, as their names ſhew, and perhaps from ſome place where their account of time was ſo imperfect, that they had no other Months in their Year, which anſwers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the <hi>Soſos</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> already deſcribed, and might well enough give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to this tradition in <hi>Ovid;</hi> and ſo much may ſuffice to have ſpoken, upon occaſion of what was firſt propoſed to be proved; namely, that there was anciently a Year or Period of <hi>ten Months,</hi> returning into it ſelf, by which they anciently mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured time in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which I think is now ſufficiently done.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, I am to prove that in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> the <hi>uſury</hi> of Money and other things was <hi>Monthly</hi> payed; from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſuppoſing the Year to have conſiſted of ten Months, that the <hi>uſura centeſima</hi> was <hi>ten</hi> in the <hi>hundred,</hi> that is, one in ten for the Year; and for the proof of this I ſhall firſt ſhew that it was ſo among the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom I have already ſhewn not only to have borrowed the names of ſome of their Months from thence, but alſo the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:98888:208"/> very words by which both the Principle and Interſt of Money, or any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable ſubſtance or thing is expreſſed in <hi>Latin,</hi> and for this I ſhall content my ſelf with the teſtimony of <hi>John Gerhard voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> in his <hi>Etymologicon,</hi> under the word <hi>Calendae. Antiquis,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>moris erat pecunias calendis credere &amp; uſuras exigere, unde eſt quod, Plutarchus libello de non fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerando, ait, Neomenias ac Calendas, Dies ſacratiſſimos, à faeneratoribus reddi nefandos ac deteſtabiles,</hi> and to this purpoſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that place of <hi>Horace, l. 1. ſat.</hi> 3.</p>

            <q>

               <l>Quaerit calendis ponere.</l>
            </q>
            <p>To which words <hi>Voſſius</hi> hath ſubjoyned this Comment. <hi>Iduum eò meminit Poeta, quod faeneratorum is fuerit mos, ut quamquam Calendis uſura deberetur, tamen in Idus concederent dilationem, Quam conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ait Pythaeus reperiſſe ſe a veteri gloſſario
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:98888:209"/> annotatam ad illud Ciceronis in catilinam,</hi> Praetermitto ruinas fortunarum tuarum quas omnes impendere tibi proximis Idibus ſenties. And this indeed is of neceſſity to be admitted, ſuppoſing the Uſury were Monthly due, as there is no queſtion but among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was, and ſuppoſing that they did <hi>Calendis ponere,</hi> put out their Mony upon the <hi>Calends</hi> or the <hi>New Moon,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> tells us in this place they did, that the Uſe muſt become due at the <hi>next</hi> Calends, or at the <hi>return</hi> of the New Moon, and if they did not exact the Uſe or call in the Principle till the Ides or the Full Moon, this muſt needs be by way of forbearance, not by any thing of right in the Debtor to defer his payment ſo long.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, not only the names of ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Months, but alſo of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends, Nones, and Ides</hi> into which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Month was divided were manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to them from the Eaſt. Indeed <hi>Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Tzetzes</hi> in his <hi>Chiliads</hi> tells us a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtory of three very charitable and well diſpoſed Gentlemen, whoſe names were <hi>Calandus, Idus,</hi> and <hi>Nonus,</hi> the firſt of which fed and ſupported the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in a great Famine eighteen days, the ſecond eight, and the laſt of them four; and in this he is followed by <hi>Balſamon</hi> upon the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:98888:209"/> Councils, but who ſees not the impoſture of this pleaſant Tale? eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the date of it, which falls ſo much lower than the known Antiquity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Month, <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> and others, have much more of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the accounts which they give, but yet their accounts are far from the truth it ſelf, which they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand for want of skill in the Learning of the Eaſt, and were for the ſame reaſon ignorant of the far greateſt part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Calendae</hi> they tell us were a <hi>Calando,</hi> becauſe then the <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> were ſummoned to a general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the <hi>Curia Kalabra,</hi> the <hi>Nonae</hi> were ſo called, <hi>quod ab iiſdem novem dies ad Idus putarentur,</hi> and the <hi>Idus</hi> were from the <hi>Greek</hi>

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:98888:210"/> if I am not much miſtaken, are to be ſought for in the only true Fountain of all ancient Learning, that is, in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and therefore from thence I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fetch them. The <hi>Calendae</hi> were as much as <hi>kahal hedah,</hi> for the New Moons were always looked upon in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as days of the moſt Sacred and Religious Solemnity in the whole Month, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from many places of Scripture, which it is altogether needleſs to inſiſt upon; and theſe Solemnities themſelves are a ſufficient indication, that there was once in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> a Year meaſured by the motion of the Moon, at the beginning of which there was always an extraordinary concourſe of People, and all the publick demonſtrations of joy and gladneſs imaginable. Such a ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as this in the <hi>Full Moon,</hi> that is, at the time of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> is expreſly called <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kehal hadath,</hi> Exod. 12. 6. and by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty it is rendred <gap reason="foreign">

And farther, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us that the <hi>Quirites</hi> on that day, were uſed to be ſummoned into the <hi>Curia Kalabra,</hi> it is to be noted that though this ſolemnity it ſelf, and the name of the time wherein it was performed were derived from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> yet they did not meet together in the <hi>Curia Kalabra,</hi> Young and Old, Men, Women, and Children, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did at the Paſſover, and other ſolemn Feaſts (though I know not, when

Laſtly, As another indication of the word <hi>Kalendae,</hi> its being of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Origination, I will argue from its being ſpelt with a <hi>k,</hi> a Letter almoſt unknown to the more Flouriſhing and polite Ages of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in this word it hath been preſerved, as well as in <hi>Karthago,</hi> anſwering in both caſes to the <hi>Hebrew Koph,</hi> in <hi>Kahal</hi> and <hi>Kereth,</hi> the latter of which ſignifies a City, (and was applyed by way of Eminence to <hi>Carthage,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> was called peculiarly <hi>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:98888:213"/> or a Year conſiſting but of one-Month, though <hi>Proclus</hi> upon the <hi>Timeus</hi> had been ſilent, and yet he tells us alſo of the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from the Authority of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>the Aegyptians called a Month a Year;</hi> for it is clear, whatever the <hi>Roman</hi> Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts are pleaſed to tell us, that the <hi>Calends</hi> did not always fall upon the <hi>New Moons,</hi> nor the <hi>Ides</hi> upon the <hi>Full,</hi> but by reaſon of the <hi>intercalation</hi> at the end of every Month, it would fall out unavoidably that the <hi>Ides</hi> and <hi>Calends</hi> and the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calations</hi> themſelves would travail by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and regular proportions, through all times of the Moons Age, and this is the true notion of <hi>Intercalatio,</hi> it is as much as <hi>intercahalatio,</hi> or it is that time which after the expiring of the <hi>Lunar Period,</hi> conſiſting of twenty eight Days or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, was added before the beginning of the next Month, when the <hi>Kahal</hi> or <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> was called; but yet the names of the <hi>Calends</hi> and <hi>Ides,</hi> (added to this Tradition which we ſee was always preſerved among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that they did at leaſt originally, light always upon the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moon, though when the Year came to be altered and the Months were brought to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:98888:213"/> with the Suns motion, it was impoſſible they ſhould do ſo;) theſe, I ſay, are clear teſtimonies that they received this diviſion of their Month from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and from ſome place where their Year was <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>unqueſtionably Lunar,</hi> and therefore it is no wonder, that in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſtory we do not find any where any ſuch fixt and ſtated Solemnities, upon the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moon, as we meet with in the Scripture Hiſtory, becauſe by reaſon of this <hi>intercalation</hi> and the reducing their Year to the courſe of the Sun, the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moon came to be neglected, but ſo, as that though the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves did not underſtand it, yet the Feſtivities and Religions which they had upon their <hi>Calends,</hi> were borrowed and taken from the <hi>New Moons</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and thoſe which they were uſed to have upon the <hi>Ides,</hi> were taken by Tradition from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Celebration of the <hi>Full Moon,</hi> which was every whit as ſacred as the other, and at this time were Celebrated by Gods own appointment the Feaſt of the <hi>paſſover,</hi> and alſo that of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Feaſt which was inſtead of the <hi>paſſover,</hi> was on the <hi>fifteenth</hi> of the <hi>eighth Month,</hi> and the Feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> ratified by an Edict of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:98888:214"/> upon the <hi>fifteenth</hi> of <hi>Adar</hi> Yearly; and this is the Second reaſon that makes it highly probable, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury</hi> was exacted <hi>Monthly</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> that not only the names of ſome of their Months, but the diviſion of them all, was manifeſtly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and derived from thence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, By this it appears that the payment of Uſury was <hi>Monthly</hi> among the Jews, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tells us ſo plainly it was the <hi>hundredth part of the Money, the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl that was exacted of them;</hi> which hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part if you underſtand it of the Year was next kin to no Uſury at all, and could not be the cauſe of ſo many loud complaints, and ſo univerſal a calamity, as at that time overwhelmed in a manner the whole Nation of the Jews; but if we underſtand it of <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>hundred,</hi> for a Month, this was <hi>twelve</hi> in the <hi>hundred</hi> for the whole Year, and this added to thoſe other cauſes of ſcarcity and dearth, which are by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in this Chapter recited, might well enough produce thoſe diſmal and deplorable effects, which it is ſaid to have done.</p>
            <p>This was the very reaſon why the <hi>tenth</hi> of all things was paid to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> for their ſupport and maintenance; for the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:98888:214"/> 
               <hi>Prieſts,</hi> are as it were the Family and Houſhold of God, who is the Great pro-prietor of all things, to whom by way of acknowledgment, for the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we receive from them, the <hi>tenth</hi> of all things was to be paid, this being, as I have ſhewn, the Ancient <hi>uſura cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſima,</hi> upon which the payment of all Tithes was founded; and though we will not ſtand too Critically upon the proportion, yet there is thus much of natural reaſon in the caſe, that the Prieſthood who are ſet apart to the Service of God, and are, or ought to be ſo great inſtruments of the publick good, ought always to have a juſt and honourable maintenance, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the People, and paid, as of right, to them, without any thing of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to their charges for it, that ſo they may be the more at leiſure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Miniſtry of the Holy things, and may have no temptation to comply with every popular humor, againſt the duty of their places, and this wellfare of the publick.</p>
            <p>But though as well by the place of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> as by the proportion of the Prieſts in the payment of Tithes, it appears that the Uſury of all things, was the <hi>centeſima</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> and <hi>twelve</hi> in the hundred, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:98888:215"/> there came to be a very great difference between the uſe of Money, and that of other things, as <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> and the like; the uſe of Money for the moſt part continued within the compaſs of the <hi>centeſima,</hi> and when it exceeded thoſe bounds, it was reſtrained by ſeveral <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Edicts, ſtill extant in the bodies of the Civil Laws, both of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> but in other things it was advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much, that is, the lender was to refund a third part increaſe, or an half of the whole, ſo as for example, he that borrowed two buſhels of Corn was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fund three, and this was that which was properly called <hi>uſura Hemiolia,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">v.

            <p>Another inſtance of a manifeſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as to the buſineſs of Uſury, was this; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> tells us, the People in his time were reduced to ſuch extremity, that they were forced to <hi>ſell their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into bondage,</hi> and ſometimes in caſes
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:98888:215"/> of this nature they ſold themſelves, though they had ſtill the priviledg to become free again, after a certain time, and could not be compelled to ſerve longer then the Year of <hi>Jubilee;</hi> the like was in the uſage of the <hi>Romans,</hi> though more ſevere and cruel, and without any ſuch return, into the ſtate of freedom after the expiration of ſuch a certain time, and they that were thus enſlaved, are called <hi>nexi</hi> and <hi>addicti corporibus,</hi> and <hi>nexu vincti,</hi> and the like in many places of <hi>Livy,</hi> and how very hard and ſevere it was of Ancient time upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Debtors, is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places very dolefully and Tragically deſcribed by him, and the ſame was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the practice among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as<note place="margin">Sup. p. 238.</note> hath been ſeen already, out of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Diog.

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſury with this obſervation, that it being forbidden the Jews only upon a Political reaſon, which had a peculiar reference to the partition of Inheritances among them, which by the practice of Uſury would have been deſtroy'd, and for no other cauſe or reaſon whatſoever that can be diſcerned in the Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but on the contrary they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:98888:216"/> to practice it upon the Stranger, where this partition was not concerned; it follows unavoidably that in any other polity, then ſuch an one as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, the practice of a <hi>moderate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury</hi> is a Lawful thing, and indeed it is no more in effect, then ſelling of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for a moderate gain, or receiving of rent for Land, and therefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> called it, not only by the name of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, from its <hi>encreaſing</hi> nature which anſwers to the <hi>Hebrew Tarbith,</hi> and <hi>Marbith,</hi> but alſo <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So that it being now abundantly proved, that the Marriage of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> was by virtue and in conſequence of that <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, by which the Brother was obliged to raiſe up ſeed to the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in caſe he deceaſed without Iſſue Male, and that the obligation of this Law, together with that partition and diſtribution of Inheritances upon which it depended, ceaſed to be any longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded among the Jews themſelves, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diviſion of the two Kingdoms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> in the time of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and that whereever the ſame ſort of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:98888:216"/> was obſerved, there either Uſury was forbidden as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or elſe the Partition was deſtroy'd and broken down by the practice of it; again, it being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not abſtain from any thing, meerly becauſe the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii</hi> or any other Nation round about them practiced it, and for no other reaſon; and laſtly that the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as to the proportion of their Uſury, and the time of payment, and many other things of their moſt remote, but yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and unqueſtionable Antiquity, were derived from thence. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now only one ſingle objection very briefly to be conſidered, which is by ſome, as well in Antiquity, as of later date alledged againſt what hath been ſaid, and that is the ſolution of <hi>Africanus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> by which he endeavours to reconcile the difference between the two Evangeliſts, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke;</hi> in the Genealogy of our Saviour which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution if it ſhould be admitted as good, it would follow that the <hi>fratres uterini,</hi> were under the ſame obligation to raiſe up Seed to their deceaſed Elder Brother, as thoſe which were born of the ſame Father, but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is ſo ſubſtantially exploded by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf, and by <hi>Grotius</hi> in his
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98888:217"/> Learned Commentary upon the Goſpels, and by <hi>Valeſius</hi> in his excellent Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who is ſo bold as to call in queſtion, as it did very well deſerve, the matter of fact it ſelf, and wiſhes that <hi>Euſebius</hi> for the credit of his Hiſtory had not inſerted it in it; as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſuppoſes the Tradition to have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and <hi>Africanus</hi> not rightly to have underſtood the meaning of his Informers: that upon all theſe accounts I think I am excuſed from a particular examination and confutation of this <hi>legend,</hi> to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ruin and diſgrace of which, ſo many truely great and Learned Men, have with ſo great unanimity and conſtancy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and all of them upon ſuch weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons, as do ſufficiently juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and recommend the Judgment of their Authors.</p>
            <p>At leaſt it is ſufficient in this caſe to ſay, what appears upon the moſt diligent inquiry to have been moſt true, that all this difference between the Evangeliſts was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned only by the careleſneſs, folly, or which is worſe, the deſign and manifeſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery of Tranſcribers, among whom in the Ancienteſt Mſs. of theſe Goſpels there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been a moſt incredible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention; they are the words of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi>
